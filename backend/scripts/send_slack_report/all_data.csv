Such a great milestone and thank you for all you have done for IDinsight and being a great leader. :tada: :gift: :balloon: :boom: 

Such an incredible milestone, Alison. Thank you for all the work you have done to make IDinsight into what it is today. :thankful-fb:

So wonderful - congratulations, Alison!!

Alison- thank you, thank you, thank you for the amazing 10 years. I totally agree. You embody all the best things about IDinsight. And so much of IDinsight is what it is because of your vision of what it can and should be, your dedication to the people and mission. We are blessed to have you. 

Congratulations @alison! It's been a joy and pleasure working with you. I've greatly benefited from your insightful feedback, thoughtful questions during meetings, guidance, and insights on IDi processes, systems, and priorities. :thank_you:

Alison, what is this org without you? We have all grown from your intelligence, kindness, leadership, and friendship. Thank you so much for everything you've continued to give :blue_heart:

@alison! Thank you for all you've given us. You very much set the tone for me when I first joined, showing me what it meant to be a good IDinsighter. I know this is the case for many others, too, possibly even a majority of the org! You're always in the background, quietly making things better and we are very lucky for it!

Wow, what a milestone Alison. We are so lucky to have had you for all these years and the mark you've made on IDinsight and the growth of many teammates is just immense. Thank you so much for all you have done!

Hello everyone! Today we had the joy of celebrating :boom:*Alison Connor’s 10th IDi-versary*:boom: in Nairobi. Her start date was January 13, 2014 in Lusaka and since then, she’s been a force for impact, mentorship, and (Oxford comma) support to hundreds of IDinsighters in every corner of the IDi-verse:blue_heart:.

As an office, we shared words that represents @alison to us: caring, supportive, detail-oriented, resilient, multi-tasking, selfless, thoughtful, generous, excellent, committed, steadfast, tender, steady, calm, brilliant, foundational, and so many more. My favorite quote “Alison embodies all the best things about IDinsight.”

So many stories were shared of the quiet ways Alison loves everyone around her- delivering meals, showing up first for a wedding after travel, checking in with unwell folks, baking many an amazing cake, remembering everything, always available to help. As well as the visible, big efforts she drives to make sure IDinsight reaches our highest potential- jumping in to any project that needs her support (no matter how oversubscribed she already is), serving as a technical leader, building community with care, always asking hard questions about impact, taking on the hardest tasks, driving Unit4 and other system efforts, delivering her projects with excellence, thinking big picture about IDinsight and global health, building our trainings (multiple ones!), and so many, many other things. It's clear that no one of us sees all the things Alison does- quietly, with grace and no complaints, with her extraordinary talents and capabilities.

@alison, *thank you* for sharing 10 amazing years so far with IDinsight, including so many milestones for the org and you and your family (so glad that Jeremy, Ethan and Noah joined us- we missed napping Aidan). We are all better because of your heart, intellect, and commitment. The small gifts and very official certificate were small tokens of appreciation, and even our words don't do justice. THANK YOU! You are very loved and we're grateful to benefit from your leadership for this tremendous decade of growth :seedling: and evolution :deciduous_tree: at IDinsight!

Hello @channel!

:tada::idi-circle: *Today we share our 10-year impact retrospective that illustrates our journey and contribution to partners' impact over the last decade!* :idi-circle::tada:

It's the result of a nine-month-long internal analysis to understand what works to best support our partners with data and evidence.
*Check it out: <http://idinsight.org/10yearreport|idinsight.org/10yearreport>* 

It highlights how we grew from five visionary co-founders to 240+ extraordinary team members and shares how our services and approach evolved to meet the needs of our partners. Finally, it provides an estimate of our impact contribution from our internal learning exercise – *the number of lives improved and dollars allocated because of our work over ten years and <https://www.idinsight.org/publication/internal-impact-measurement-methodology/|our methodology> for calculating this.*

:mega: *Help us share this important story!*
• _View and share our impact microsite <http://idinsight.org/10yearreport|here>_.
• _We have put together <https://drive.google.com/file/d/16ET2wSvoXedxzN7zmRqAkgc_1naXWS-6/view?usp=sharing|this social media toolkit> to make it easy for you to amplify through your networks. (You just have to click to tweet!)_ 
    ◦ _*Don't forget to add our hashtags: #IDinsightat10 #IDinsight10yrs*_

IDinsight User Manual

Everything you need to know about working with: Alison Connor

19 Apr 2021





What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?

I think out loud a lot and am not naturally a structured thinking (but this is something I working on). 

I over-appreciate detail. 

Sometimes I vocalize dissent only later. 

What drives you nuts?

Macro-level – Complacency & entitlement

Micro-level – When people repeat things I say as it if it is their idea; poor grammar and spelling



What are your quirks?

I speak in examples a lot – don’t get caught up in the examples. 

I repeat my message and overexplain – I believe this is because my mother was a middle school teacher, not because I think you are dense.



How can people earn an extra gold star with you?

Be amazing at managing up

Ask for help when you need it

Be proactive

Take ownership and hold oneself accountable

Use my time well

Give me at least 24 hours to review something

What qualities do you particularly value in people who work with you?

Honesty

Eagerness to learn, to try something outside of their comfort zone

Curiosity



What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

I don’t need everything to be perfect before it comes my way (but people should note that it is not in a final version)

People can talk to me about challenges and mistakes. I think this is an important part of learning.

:star: :beginner:New Project Announcement: *Ask-A-Question 2.0*:beginner: :star:

Hello Team! We've got thrilling news to share about our work on Ask-A-Question (AAQ). Building on our successful partnership with Reach Digital (aka Praekelt) for MomConnect :flag-za: last year, we're ecstatic to announce that Google is now championing us to push the boundaries of our chatbot capabilities even further! :stars:

:date: Timeline and Commitments:
Thanks to an incredible $1.1M grant from Google, we're on a 2-year journey that would enable us to 1) rekindle our partnership with Reach and 2) infuse AAQ with cutting-edge AI features like:
• LLM-powered FAQ-matching :bookmark: and urgency detection :pregnant_woman::skin-tone-3::exclamation:
• Response in local languages like Zulu and Xhosa :speaking_head_in_silhouette:
• Multi-turn chat :speech_balloon:  and exchange over voice notes :microphone:
These are ambitious goals but with leaders like @Suzin and @Sid Ravinutala steering the ship :ship:, and a stellar :star: team featuring @Amir @Zia @Carlos (and many more to join), we're well-prepared for the voyage :sunny:

:globe_with_meridians: Expanding Horizons:
A portion of this funding is earmarked for 'productizing' AAQ, opening new frontiers with fresh clients in diverse contexts beyond South Africa and maternal health. We're also committed to open sourcing the codebase to foster community collaboration and innovation.

If any of these keywords - digital outreach, helplines, chatbots, AI, WhatsApp - resonate with you in the context of a client or a specific challenge, we are on the lookout for leads! Please reach out to me or @Sid Ravinutala

:pray: Gratitude:
This monumental project has involved the hard work of most DSEM team members at some point. A massive shoutout to everyone for your dedication and unwavering commitment. :raised_hands:
Stay tuned for more updates as we continue our journey to make AAQ a radiant star in our company's product portfolio.

Notes HERE
DOH background on HPLS:
                                             * Health settings
                                             * Need to work on many different sectors
                                             * HPFS covers 7 priority pillars
                                             * Health literacy - need to affect this to get positive behavior
                                             * Health outcomes measured by PSA through NDHS
                                             * Work on IDi will measure Health Literacy; will set up the systems to monitor this anually
                                             * Behavioral outcomes - hard to monitor
                                             * 5-year study
                                             * National and regional level - IDi will conduct the study annually; at the same time capacitating the local level to have their own HL assessment as part of the LHS maturity in line with the Mandanas ruling (UHC-IS)
                                             * Note: PSA does not understand the concept of UHC-IS… 
                                             * Workstreams: (1) Comprehensive, Functional LIteracy and KAP; qual studies on barriers, barriers in terms of mental health (what are these?) cannot be captured in a quant study; and (2) Capacity Building
                                             * Timeline: Oct, First run of data collection in March, timely for budget preparation for 2024 
DOH HPLS
                                             * Submit clearance by December 16
PSA Comments
                                             * Estimates will be national only
                                             * 3-stage sampling; individuals will be chosen per HHs
                                             * SG: Sarah said national AND regional????? [aw]
                                             * Do you want to capture the life cycle? - DOH wants to capture adults
                                             * ?? Young Lives study - started with newborn and are now 26 years old; if you want to identify HLS and health indicators; think about who you will follow instead of just a group of adults
                                             * If we do national level study, might not be helpful in capacitating LGUs? What if you do a focused survey? - There could be a focus on a specific population in the future. 
                                             * National objectives: Inform DOH HPB Central Office
                                             * Local objectives: In the long-run, capacitate LGUs
                                             * PSA is doing CBMS - capacitate LGUs; after data collection; collecting data at a census level, using data to capacitate LGUs; PSA developing modules to capacitate LGUs to come up with policies and have health questions.

                                             * 1.1 Citizens are health literate, and have good health-seeking behavior - need to get these sldies and share with HPLS - hoping there will be some discussion around this and the definition of exact indicators!
                                             * Functional health literacy (HPLS)
                                             * From Sarah we were already aware of this, already in our survey
                                             * Comprehensive health literacy (HPLS)
                                             * From Sarah we were already aware of this
                                             * Diet and phyiscal activity 
                                             * Filipinos consuming healthy diet (HPLS)
                                             * They must already have a definition for what they mean as  ‘met’ vs ‘unmet’... we need to get this!
                                             * Proportion of Filipinos sufficient physical activity(HPLS) -
                                             *  Similarly - they must have a definition already of met vs unmet as it’s already in HSS - we need to get to structure our question here!
                                             * Environmental health
                                             * Proportion of Filipinos improved sanitation practices
                                             * Practice sustainable lifestyle
                                             * Similar question - we need HPB to be specific about how they’ve defined these indicators
                                             * Disaster preparedness
                                             * Vaccination
                                             * Fully immunised children
                                             * Whole target on this 
                                             * Full adult immunisation
                                             * Again need the definition on this
                                             * Substance use:
                                             * Current tobacco use - mention GATS as a source of data on this - no mention of vaping, and no mention of health literacy - might be more scope to cut than we currently thought? 
                                             * Alcohol - focus is on binge drinking specifically 
                                             * Mental health:
                                             * Proportion of Filipinos practicing self-care is listed as an indicator in HSS - so questions on this are unavoidable 
                                             * Perfecnt of Filipinos who attempted suicide (data source: YAFS)
                                             * Suicide mortality (data source: WHO)
                                             * All the family planning/SRH  - all the data sources for this were listed as NDHS, there was no mention of health literacy
                                             * Violence prevention
                                             * Death rate due to road traffic… they have admin data on this as a main source fo the indicator
                                             * OUr questions here should focus on the drivers of RTAs (I think we’re already doing this with the qs on drunk driving/texting/knowledge of road signs) - but let’s revisit and see if there’s anything more useful we can do!

How is DOH thinking about the alignment between HPLS and other studies that touch on the 7 priority behaviors? (ex. Global adult tobacco survey, young adult reproductive health survey) 
                                                                                                                                                                                    2. How will the HPLS study feed into the health sector strategies for 2023-2028?

Before we get the participation of LGUs, they’ll want to see HLA results
                                          * A: Yes, HPB has a deck, preparing regional-specific with provincial-level results -Sarah
                                          * Q: For the pilot, are regions already identified? 
                                          * A: Pilot sites are being finalized, will coordinate with CHDs by EOW
                                          * Sarah: IDinsight hopes to speak directly with LGUs, hoping that CHDs can help facilitate this. Asking CHDs to share endorsement letters to LGUs. 
                                          * Q: Next rounds will be done by IDi enumerators? 
                                          * Yes, HPLS to be conducted by IDinsight. 
                                          * Sarah said that we’ll generate nationally-representative data, then said something about breaking it down by region? 
                                          * The part that’s tied to LHS-ML is capacity building, still being developed by IDi.
                                          * madaming issue po kasi yung self administered survey (what does this mean?) – “there are lots of issues with self-administered surveys”
Dec 7, 2022 Check-in with DOH
                                          1. Participants: Everyone, Kim Vidal Ask Rodley to join? (we've got high-level things to discuss)
                                          2. Venue: Kim Vidal to check with Sarah
                                          3. Time: 9AM @ DOH
                                          4. Agenda [SLIDES]:
                                          1. Get DOH inputs on overall research protocol (10 mins)
                                          1. Discussing (HSS?) M&E coordinators with Anne Rey
                                          2. Capacity Building
                                          1. Comments from Sarah:
                                          1. Re. ‘commissioning’ data: will they have to hire/outsource for them to conduct their local assessments? as much as possible we want them to be able to do the assessments already and set up the operations after their capacity development
                                          2. Re. Topics for capacity building topics or context-based focus of the questions and translation to policy or programs?
                                          2. AR: We’ll work on the capacity building component after we submit the research methodology.
                                          3. SG: When we conducted the HLA, we only had 2 enumerators at the regional level. They don’t have designated people at the local level.
                                          4. KV: We have training decks about commissioning surveys from a previous project.
                                          3. Data Sharing Agreement
                                          1. No need - we already have all the data that we need from PSA, nothing requires DSA
                                          2. Discuss data collection & more detailed sampling update (20 mins) - Alex/Mikka
                                          1.

Nov 3, 2022 Alignment on PSA meeting agenda and Misc Clarifications
Participants: 
                                             * Alice, Kim, Alex (IDi); Sarah (DOH) 
Agenda
                                             * Agenda here
Notes:
                                             * Alice: Mikka to lead tomorrow’s meeting with PSA 
                                             * Currently have shortlisted options; final approach depends on what we can access from PSA 
                                             * Objective: Understand processes to access data from PSA 
                                             * DOH comments on the agenda
                                             * Re: Introduction of DOH 
                                             * SG to create DOH slide decks covering: context of DOH, responsibilities and the project
                                             * Re: UHC
                                             * SG: Raise a portion of the UHC study - AR will just say that it's happening
                                             * Concerned that PSA may ask questions about UHC because HPB can't answer any questions
                                             * AR: Keep it in to provide context and so they know about it; Alice to cover any questions they have about
                                             * SG: Is there overlap between UHC and HPLS?
                                             * AR: Yes, which is why sampling applies to both. UHC is approx. 2 mos behind. LJ has been meeting with PSA separately. 
                                             * SG: Can we ask HPDPB about PSA? 
                                             * AR: UHC diff from HPLS because it’s not a panel; plan is to turn over the survey to PSA 
                                             * PSA will be less involved with HPLS vs. UHC 
                                             * Re: PSA processes
                                             * SG suggests to include in the agenda: Clearance + timeline for clearance 
                                             * AR: We already know this (from DepEd)
                                             * Alexandra Agcaoilito put a slide in the deck
                                             * Re: Contact person
                                             * DOH will try to get a contact person and a statistician we can contact
                                             * Re: participants
                                             * Questions for the PSA meeting
                                             * Venue at Park Inn by Radisson North EDSA? - Sarah confirming attendees within DOH, messaging PSA about the venue
                                             * DOH would like to take part in the agenda? - Yes, they're presenting at the start
                                             * Others and Non-PSA questions
                                             * Physical copies
                                             * For the TOP, it's stated that what they would check is the Inception Report and a Final Work Plan. Two separate documents. Otherwise, Accounting will be confused.

👉 The library on the right is the IDinsight library with static data visuals, ideal for reports and presentations . It provides examples and includes easy-to-follow code for Stata and R, using IDinsight branding. Copy-paste the code, change the variables into your project variables, and you can generate branded, neat and clear graphs. Different variations of these graph types are included:
- Bar graphs
- Line and scatter plots
- Maps
- Others, such as Kernel density graphs and Sankey diagrams
In a rush, and not very comfortable with Stata or R? Consider using DataWrapper , that uses AI to create visuals from cleaned datasets.

Interactive Visuals: Dashboard Guidance
👉 If you're looking to build visual that people can interact with, or simple dashboards, you can find the EMS Dashboard Portfolio (partly for internal use only) below. As a general rule, Looker Studio can help you for quick (once-off) visuals. Superset can be more useful if you're looking to build (simple) dashboards. If you need more advanced dashboards, you should liaise with the DSEM team. If you're unsure about which platform works best for you, use the selection slides below.
📌 If you're building a monitoring dashboard make sure to read the IDinsight blog on tips for building great monitoring dashboards .

Go visual!
With knowledge of the dashboarding tool’s potential to fulfill user needs, you should be at a stage to think about the interface design. The interface should deliver an experience that strongly informs the decisions the user needs to make. For reference, you could review existing public dashboards similar to your use case or pick inspiration from websites like Dribbble and other tool-specific galleries . 1 It will also be helpful to brush up on best practices around data visualization. 2
If there are equivalent indicator buckets within the dashboard’s scope, like for various departments within a government, you could dedicate a separate page for each bucket. It is best to start the flow with a high-level overview followed by deep dives into various dimensions of the program being monitored (across time, geography, or other units of interest). Referring to the indicator prioritization framework, you should narrow down the types of charts you’d require, their X and Y axes, and what filters they would be responsive to. 
It is recommended to use wireframing tools for your first draft. Miro , Draw , PowerPoint, or sometimes just pen and paper sketches are great for communicating ideas that are difficult to present verbally.
Visual ideas deserve visual representation. Example of a low-fidelity design mockup for a dashboard screen.
6. Embrace the crash test
Be quick to present the first draft to your users and solicit feedback, either as a wireframe or a scrappy prototype. Talk about why you made certain design choices and seek the user’s input on usability. The intention is to test your assumptions and check for key requirements you might have missed in your first draft.
Also, keep examples of similar dashboards handy in case you need to showcase other features or design options. Note that the user might raise new feature requests, but since not all features would be high priority or feasible, try to address the user’s concerns behind the requests and not the requests themselves.
It is important that you don’t start building data pipelines right away. Use dummy data until the user approves the first draft because it’s completely possible that they suggest some heavy changes. With this first set of inputs, you may need to reassess the project timeline, rebuild expectations and possibly revisit the drawing board.
You can’t fall in love with your dashboard just yet.

﻿Requirements Gathering - Guiding Questions
Drafted by Sandra Huluka | Last Updated December, 2022


Dashboard Purpose
1. Who is the target audience for this dashboard? (Distinguish users as primary, secondary, tertiary) 
Primary User: The primary user is the main user of the dashboard, who will interact with it most frequently and will primarily benefit from it. They usually have a direct relationship with the data being presented.
Secondary User: The secondary user is someone who may not use the dashboard as frequently as the primary user, but still requires access to the data for reference purposes. They may not have a direct relationship with the data, but still benefit from having access to it.
Tertiary User: The tertiary user is someone who has a peripheral interest in the data, and may only use the dashboard occasionally. They have the least amount of interaction with the dashboard, but still benefit from having access to the data when they need it.


2. What are key questions each intended user expects to address using this dashboard?


3. How will the dashboard be actionable for each user?  (What actions are the users trying to take based on this dashboard?) (Identify actionable KPIs here)




4. What are the pain points this dashboard aims to address?




5. What events/meetings will trigger users to view the dashboards? If there will be regular review meetings, what officials would be at those meetings?

6. Is there a team or a focal person that manages data and information management within the organization?


7. Are there any special requirements or constraints for the dashboard users that we should be aware of in terms of usability and accessibility? Examples: language requirements, limitations around numeracy/literacy, device access, and connectivity.


8. Additional notes on users


Data Availability and Requirements
1. Are indicators for dashboarding selected?


2. Is the indicator's priority defined for the users identified?


3. Are all the data sources needed for each indicator and key question currently available? (Identify if historical data is available, indicators that might need dummy data creation)


4. What are the main data sources?

Has anyone here ever created a dashboard to monitor survey operations? Looking for as many examples as possible on the kinds of indicators tracked and how those indicators are visualised.

For Nano, we outputed data from high frequency check to Excel. Here is the Excel file we used. The first 3 tabs are probably most relevant. Let me know if you have questions @Kondwani @Valentina @ana.chaves

1. Dash_all: enumerator level info for the entire data collection period.
2. Dash_yest: enumerator level info for the most recent day of data collection.
3. Dash_vc_progress: overall data collection progress by village cluster

Have you talked to @Anirudha Vaddadi?

Thanks so much @Nate Vernon - this is extremely helpful.

@will t. not yet, will reach out

@Madhav Seth also I forgot to add that we will be setting up a dashboard for DoD within the next two weeks... will share when it's ready

@Sophia the dashboard we used for NI midline might be relevant here

@Bence Kocsis and @akash.pattanayak made a nice dashboard for the DoD-FI survey.

@andrew @Eric Dodge - another datapoint that this could be a useful public good for innovation to deveoop

Thanks for the tag, Felicia!
@Madhav Seth, I am attaching the dashboard the New Incentives team used during midline. We developed this on the fly during fieldwork so it's not very elegant but it was definitely useful.
A bit of context: Our midline data collection was not a household-level but a clinic-level data collection. We collected different administrative records on vaccinations (referred to as tallysheets, cirs, mis, etc. in the dashboard) from each clinic. For each record, there was a different survey enumerators had to complete. Hence, we needed the dashboard to track for each clinic which records had been collected. The dashboard allowed us to easily identify if there was a clinic where a record had not been collected, and to follow up with enumerators/supervisors regarding the reason (e.g. not uploaded to SurveyCTO, record not available, etc.).

@Madhav Seth we developed for DOD, from small scale to large scale.

@Ali has a whole thing going on.

This document presents key insights and takeaways from the MIS workstream and the first round of baseline data collection in Hauz Rani, Delhi. We reflect on the challenges and learnings from both workstreams in the context of the C2P collaboration between July 2023 - January 2024.  




MIS Workstream




Background  
Drawing on the Theory of Change co-created with all consortium partners, IDinsight led the set-up and design of the monitoring systems for the C2P pilot. From the C2P lens, developing MIS systems meant understanding the indicators and data systems of each of the four operations organizations and developing systems that best suit the needs of the C2P collective. Two principles informed the work: 1) participatory development and 2) sustainability, i.e. no dependency should be created on one organization in future, which could limit the scaleup.




IDinsight led two rounds of calls with each consortium partner to understand their internal monitoring and evaluation systems, softwares, the use of data for decision making and indicators relevant to the C2P program. Based on the outputs of these calls, IDinsight created a final list of indicators for the C2P pilot. We presented the list of indicators to all GC and IC members during the MIS workshop (September 2023). 




To onboard the C2P Operations team onto the monitoring systems, IDinsight held a three-day long training with the operations team. IDinsight then led a three-day training for FLWs on data collection, data quality, use of SurveyCTO and dignity (October 2023). 




Since the C2P Operations team onboarding, IDinsight held weekly four-hour long co-working sessions with the team, supporting in form coding, form testing, monitoring data quality, and training/data collection planning. As of January 30, the IDinsight team held 12 half-day co-working sessions. The objective of the co-working sessions is to build the skills, capacities and confidence of the C2P Operations team to lead data collection activities independently. 




We have structured the learnings and reflections below along four components: 1) Needs 2) Decision making 3) Capacity Building and 4) Communication. 




Learning and Insights 
Data collection needs of partners - Each organization needs to be clear on the indicators they plan to collect as part of operations and why those indicators would serve the project's needs. Due to frequent revisions, the indicator finalization process took more time (by two months) than anticipated. This had a snowball effect as it meant changing SurveyCTO coding, translations and repeated form testing. 
Decision-making: Jointly, as a group, it is important to reflect on the pace of decision-making. We need to consider the requirements of all the members of the consortium and, at the same time, try to be nimble. At times, we felt that the decision-making process took time, even after the best efforts of all the stakeholders concerned. For example, decisions around the usage of software platforms (for example, SCTO and Avni) and data ownership took approximately two to three months. What could we do to reduce this time? 
Capacity building - It is given that data gets generated and collected as part of operations. Working on the principle that operational data should be owned and collected by those in charge of conducting the operations without additional efforts, we focused on the following. 
Building systems for data collection without impacting the overall operations     
Building capacity and ownership related to collecting operational data
We feel that the overall objective related to the latter objective may be partially completed. This could be due to competing priorities from different organizations. It is essential to progress in this direction as this would be cost-effective and would ensure no dependency during the scaleup stage.  
A potential solution for discussion - A dedicated MIS point person from the Operations team to lead the monitoring workstream could be a way forward. This person could lead the coding of SCTO forms (future scaleup needs could be different), add questions to the current forms, troubleshoot, and lead data quality-related aspects that have already been designed and set up. 
Communication - To get the momentum going, communication and coordination between all the partners would be another critical area where joint efforts could be helpful. This is because there is a high dependency on the tasks of different organizations. We reflect that communication was lacking or slow during the MIS workstream at various stages. This could be due to a lack of intra-organizational consensus on what data/indicators we should collect as part of the program. Coordinating between the consortium partners would be facilitated if all organizations together worked in this direction.    








Baseline Survey




Background  
In January 2024, the C2P Operations team led the in-person baseline survey with the caregivers of the MCD Urdu School in Hauz Rani, Delhi. 




Training - The C2P Operations team conducted the baseline training on November 29, 30, and December 1 (half day). The initial timeline for the launch of baseline data collection was December 4, 2023. Due to delays linked to data ownership agreements, the data collection launch was pushed until January 9 (preceded by a full-day refresher training on January 8). After three days of field operations, a half-day refresher was conducted (January 15). This is a standard practice recommended by IDinsight to ensure high-quality data.




Field operations - The C2P Operations team identified 92 caregivers interested in the program. Field operations took place over 8 days. The team consisted of 12 FLWs, 3 Project Coordinators, a Project Manager, members of the IDinsight team and a member of the Saajha team. At the end of each day, the C2P Operations Team led debriefs and ran data quality checks. 




The last full-team field day was on January 23. As of January 31, out of the 92 interested caregivers, FLWs conducted 39 baseline surveys. Table 1 displays the survey statuses.

The C2P Operations team will continue conducting appointment-based baseline surveys until the second or third week of February 2024. FLWs will make an additional 3 attempts to set up an appointment with the remaining caregivers (40 remaining caregivers).




Learnings and Insights 
Data quality (in terms of caregivers’ data) - The list of interested caregivers included 103 entries. 11 of those entries were duplicate families (either duplicate caregivers or more than one caregiver per household or caregivers with children attending the MCD Urdu School). In small and resource-intensive operations having incorrect entries around ~10% is not advisable. These numbers could be much higher during the scale-up. We need to jointly think about systems and communication that could prevent it from happening in future. 
Relationships between caregivers and FLWs - During the baseline operations, we noted that limited relations and trust were established between caregivers and FLWs. Few caregivers were not aware of the C2P program. We completed the baseline survey with 42% of the initially interested caregivers. FLWs encountered challenges with contacting the caregivers (a few caregivers blocked FLWs’ numbers), scheduling appointments and attending appointments. We should plan to dedicate sufficient field time to relationship building. 
FLWs’ performance - FLWs’ performance varied significantly during the baseline survey and establishing relationships with caregivers. Some FLWs had good ties with the community, while others had limited relations. Some FLWs grasped the baseline questionnaire quickly and were able to administer it, while other FLWs continued to struggle with question comprehension and data quality. Going forward, we should keep in mind efficiently supporting FLWs who require more assistance. 
Operational Planning - Another reflection is that we should consider operational constraints such as school holidays, festivals, and caregivers’ availability when planning a data collection exercise.

Hello IDinsighters:

Please join me in welcoming to IDinsight *Philile Shongwe* and *Rico Bergemann*!  

*Philile* joins IDinsight from the Institute for Empirical Research in Political Economy (IREEP) where she conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to complement an impact evaluation that examines the impact of supplementary Math teachers on learning outcomes and aspirations of girls in 90 high schools from across Benin. Prior to that, she spent a year in Benin as a Princeton-in-Africa Fellow where she, among several roles, organized research seminars and workshops, taught foundational English to students applying to PhD programs in the United States and Canada, and conducted literature reviews and edited research manuscripts for publication. She’s also had roles with the Clinton Health Access Initiative and Africa Health Placements. Philile has a Bachelor of Arts degree with a double major in Global Affairs and French from Yale. She will be joining the new Senegal office as an Associate.

*Rico* comes to us from the German Embassy in Lusaka where he managed communications and public relations for the Embassy. He’s previously worked as an M&amp;E Advisor for Go Ahead!, a German NGO that works in sub-Saharan Africa on education and health for orphans and vulnerable children. Rico established Go Ahead!’s M&amp;E Department, designed and integrated an M&amp;E system into the NGO’s programs, and led the monitoring of their education and health project portfolio. He’s also interned at GIZ in Lusaka and at the German Embassy in Pretoria.  Rico holds a Master of Science degree in International Development and Management from Lund University in Sweden and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Economics from Ruprecht-Karls-University in Heidelberg, Germany. Rico will be joining the Johannesburg office as an Associate.

Welcome, Philile and Rico!! :star: :earth_africa:

Hi @Fola - apologies in advance if this has been communicated elsewhere and I just missed it. Is there a new encryption system now? Or is this covered through this new perimeter 81?

I have files I need to encrypt and I am not sure if I should still use BC or another platform?

Hi @Rico, no apologies necessary. We just obtained a new Encryption tool - Axcrypt. @Alvin Munai is working on assigning licenses as we speak.  @Alvin Munai Please, could we prioritize Rico, as he has an immediate need as well? Thank you so much!

Hey @Rico, I have shared with you a licence via email. Please check and confirm

Great - thanks @Alvin Munai

@Alvin Munai, can you check in on this and update as necessary? Thanks!

Hi @Alvin Munai! Can you also please change the SCC Rabat point person and only put @Pierre Schlegel ? :innocent:

Hi @Alvin Munai! Please also change the Queer Club contact persons to me, @Jwalin and @Rico. Thank you!

Thanks @neilbuddy.shah. I agree that this is a great channel to keep up with what all our teams across the world are working so hard on. I would like to add to your comments: I would also like to see more critical reflections about what did not go well that might be a good lesson learnt for other projects. I think an internal platform like this is a safe space to not only highlight what went well, but also to honestly share about the smaller and bigger challenges teams faced that may help other teams and the wider organization to learn from each other. 

.

Strong second on what Rico said. Ideally, this will include aspects of what did/not go well technically or with our services (and why), of what did/not go well in terms of relationship and stakeholder management, and what did/not go well in terms of moving the client to a new equilibrium and/or driving decisions and actions. Would be great to see projects revisited on this channel of (lack of) decisions and actions are picked up later!

Great point, agree with Rico and Heather!

great points, @Rico and @hlanthorn. I strongly agree, Rico, that we should really use this as a forum to identify challenges and things that went wrong. Also, @jeff_m pointed out to me yesterday that it might be useful for anyone writing project updates to send a quick draft over to me or @nicholas.parker if they want any comments before posting. but overall, I also don't want to make it cumbersome to post on this channel! important to maintain this channel as a low-effort way to share new and complete projects, our thinking on getting to impact, and as rico/heather point out, honestly talk about challenges we faced!

(thanks for pinning the message, @Ari. I've updated it now to reflect rico and heather's points)

Thanks so much for this post, @Rico! These are really difficult issues and I appreciate all of the efforts to support all of our staff (including enumerators) and ensure we are equipped to handle these challenging conversations. Have you heard of Thrive Worldwide? <https://www.thrive-worldwide.org/index.php/> They provide counseling services but also can consult on equipping organizations to better prepare and support staff in challenging situations. They do also focus on Western audiences, but I think it could still be worth seeing if they can help adapt materials to local contexts. I know their CEO if you would like to learn more.

Thanks, @alison! :pray:   cc @Hassan Saad

Thank you so much @Rico and @Hassan Saad for putting in all this work and thought to lead such an important initiative! I agree that this filling an important organizational gap in how we currently prepare and accompany Associates and field teams during fieldwork. :+1: :pray:

cc @Lorraine d'Anglejan @Viola Fur

@Rico, can we upload the most up-to-date deck here and wherever else it may be needed.

Some competencies falling under both functional and behavioural
Same course mapped to both behavioural and functional
Walkthough of the template
Same course can have one competency multiple sub-themes
Some senior officers wanted half year wise competencies (added to the drop downs) 
Need to have course IDs because multiple courses with similar names (iGOT has course ID, but for non-iGOT can add name of provider with course name)
Adil- CBC: Look at ministries which account for bulk of domain courses, map those and then map others - eg telecom, postal
Start mapping iGOT courses to domain competencies
All courses, regardless of where they are from, they should be mapped to KCM
Each consulting agency will have a POC from the SPV and the CBC, who can triangulate between each other.

Putting stringent reporting or tracking is the easy way out and might not be the most effective or moral way to ensure impact. It calls for the donors to take accountability for the impact and to do ensure they work with these communities and NGOs in ways that understands their work, their motivation and their constraints and being partners toward impact.

For the attention of
Dr. Joseph Mulenga
Zambia National Blood Transfusion Service
P/B RW 1X
UTH Grounds
Lusaka, Zambia

Dear Dr. Joseph Mulenga,
I am writing on behalf of IDinsight Zambia Ltd. to formally request authorization to access specific datasets held by the Zambia National Blood Transfusion Service (ZNBTS) for our project to develop donor and non-donor profiles to inform your blood collection campaign strategy.
We are seeking access to two distinct types of data:
Donor Databases: We request access to the donor database for Lusaka province and relevant data from outside provinces. Names, phone numbers, and other demographic information will be used to sample and conduct surveys with past and current donors. These surveys will give insight into their attitudes and characteristics, informing our strategies to encourage regular and repeat donations.
Blood Unit Requests and Utilization Data: We also require blood unit requests and utilization records within the Lusaka province. This data will enable us to analyze the extent of blood shortages, understand the specific uses of donated blood, and distinguish between normal and specialized services. This data can be entirely de-identified as personally identifiable information is not required for this analysis.
All data accessed by IDinsight will be handled with confidentiality and solely used for the purpose of this project. Please reference our data agreement for details on data confidentiality. Additionally, we are willing to comply with any protocols that ZNBTS deems necessary to safeguard data and the privacy of its donors and patients.
Thank you for considering our request. We look forward to working with you and these data to positively impact Zambia’s blood supply and public health.
Sincerely, 

Dr. Sylvia Mwamba

The key influencing factors to maximizing HubGPT’s efficiency gains are how many employees use the tool, and how often they use it - and those numbers won’t increase just by conveying the existence of a new tool, no matter how ‘cool’ it may be. Our colleagues are busy, and inclined to stick to what they know during crunch-time. After realizing that announcements on regional AHMs and launch messages on Slack channels would not be enough (despite adequate emoticon usage, mind you), we invested in building a more aggressive change management strategy.

We shifted from relying on a verbose guideline document to convey HubGPT’s value, to hosting interactive walkthroughs across regions to show employees those benefits firsthand, host open Q&A forums and collect real-time feedback. We are continuing to proselytize the usage of HubGPT in response to all KM queries/discussion boards and requesting top users to share their experiences on employee forums. ",PROJECTS

In the final outcome of the Bihar assembly elections, what drew attention to some of the successful Muslim candidates was the fact that the All India Muslim Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) won five seats in the north-eastern Seemanchal region, where Muslims form about half of the population (from 77.5% in Jokihat to 38% in Araria).

However, the AIMIM’s MLAs represent less than a third of the 19 Muslims who were elected to the assembly this year. This shows that there is more to Muslim political participation in Bihar than the AIMIM’s breakthrough. This article offers a typology of the forms of political dynamics among Muslims in Bihar — the basic idea being that Muslim political dynamics are different in minority and majority areas.

Muslim (majority) politics: The AIMIM’s foray in Seemanchal

When looking at Muslim political participation in Bihar, one of the interesting characteristics of the state is that it includes both Muslim minority and majority (or near-majority) areas. This leads to two distinct political dynamics. In areas where they are not in a majority, Muslims seem subject to a kind of minority syndrome and thus more concerned with security than with collective assertion. In the Muslim majority areas, on the other hand, a space opens up for ‘Muslim politics’, that is, a political discourse that stresses the need for Muslims to be politically represented on their own terms and to voice community-specific concerns. The AIMIM’s and Asaduddin Owaisi’s politics fall into this category. Owaisi explicitly states the need for ‘Muslim politics’, as for instance in this interview: “The realization among Bihar Muslims and everywhere is that we require an independent political voice.” This worked well this time in Seemanchal, where in 13 constituencies Muslims account for at least 40% of the population. Yet Seemanchal is not new to Muslim politics. Syed Shahabuddin, the editor of Muslim India and a prominent voice on ‘Muslim issues’ — from the Shah Bano case to the destruction of the Babri Masjid — had for instance won the Lok Sabha seat of Kishanganj in 1991.

While the AIMIM has made its entrance in Bihar in the latest elections, its candidates are also not new to politics, but are professional politicians. The party’s anti-BJP rhetoric that invoked the charged atmosphere of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests fostered wide popularity among Muslim youth. Yet the comfortable margins the AIMIM achieved in the five constituencies it won — Amour, Kochadhaman, Jokihat, Baisi and Bahadurgunj — could hardly have been possible without candidates with political experience.

    [T]he local standing of candidates was crucial for the AIMIM’s victories in Bihar. 

The main organizer of the AIMIM in Bihar, Akhtarul Iman — who won in Amour with a margin of 52,000 votes — had been a Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MLA between 2005 and 2014. The winner in Bahadurganj, Anzar Naeemi, had been candidate on a RJD ticket in 2010 and joined the AIMIM only in August 2020. In Jokihat, the contest was a family affair. Shahnawaz Alam, the son of eight-time MLA and one-time MP Muhammad Tasleemuddin, was contesting against his elder brother, Sarfaraz Alam of the RJD, who had been elected three times to the assembly seat (with the RJD in 2000 and then the Janata Dal (United), or JDU, in 2010 and 2015) and once to a parliamentary seat in a by-election (with the RJD in 2018). In Baisi, Syed Ruknuddin Ahmad had previously won as an independent in 2005 and had later joined the JDU. And in Kochadhaman, the winner, Muhammad Izhar Asfi, had been a panchayat mukhiya (head) and an old associate of Akhtarul Iman. Asfi also happened to unseat his own son-in-law, four-time Congress MLA Tausif Alam.

Thus, the local standing of candidates was crucial for the AIMIM’s victories in Bihar — combined with the popularity of Asaduddin Owaisi and Akhtarul Iman, and, in some places, a subtle balance between local dominant communities. The AIMIM had to appeal to Seemanchal’s two largest social groups among Muslims. The Surjapuris — considered to be Shaikh and therefore part of the dominant Ashraf cluster — are in large numbers in Kishanganj district, while the marginalized Kulhaiya — who were included in the category of Extremely Backward Classes created by Nitish Kumar’s government in 2005 — constitute a significant group in Araria district. The AIMIM’s winning candidates hail from the numerically dominant community of their respective constituencies: Surjapuri Shaikh for Akhtarul Iman, Anzar Naeemi, and Izhar Asfi in Kishanganj and Purnia districts, and Kulhaiya for Shahnawaz Alam in Araria district. To help the AIMIM candidates win over the Kulhaiya vote, Shahnawaz Alam campaigned with them in their constituencies. Finally, the AIMIM’s fifth MLA, in Baisi, is a Sayyid — the highest social group among Muslims that claims descent from Prophet Muhammad — whose family has long been integrated with the Surjapuri environment.

    In none of the constituencies where the NDA won and the MGB came in second place did the AIMIM obtain a vote share greater than the winning party’s margin. 

The AIMIM’s rise in Seemanchal attracted media attention and much condemnation from the Congress party and the RJD. The role of ‘kingmaker’ that some analysts expected the party to play did not materialize — the AIMIM’s five seats were not enough to help the Mahagathbandhan (MGB) form a majority, were it indeed to join the alliance. Yet accusations of the AIMIM being responsible for the MGB’s failure to win enough seats to form the government were repeatedly expressed. The allegation, however, does not hold upon closer analysis. In none of the constituencies where the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won and the MGB came in second place did the AIMIM obtain a vote share greater than the winning party’s margin. In other words, the fact that the AIMIM contested these seats did not siphon off enough votes from the MGB to be responsible for its defeat.

The more elaborate construction of the ‘vote katwa’ (vote cutting) or ‘BJP ki B team’ (BJP’s B team) allegation targets Owaisi’s rhetoric of Muslim politics and questions his commitment to secularism and democracy.

    In spite of the AIMIM’s past and the occasional radical actions of some of its members … the party’s popularity and electoral successes in recent years do not rest on a radical discourse but operate within the framework of electoral democracy. 

On the night of the election results, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera held that Owaisi’s politics spark radicalization among Muslim youth by seeking to counter the BJP’s radical discourse. Khera spoke of a “mutually reinforced radicalization” that makes Owaisi a “partner with right-wing radicalization”. This idea blames Owaisi for participating in Hindu-Muslim polarization on an equal footing with the BJP, supposedly contributing to bolstering politicians with majoritarian claims and side-lining the potential weight of Muslim voters. Yet this accusation confusingly blends two processes: radicalization and polarization. In spite of the AIMIM’s past and the occasional radical actions of some of its members (Akbaruddin Owaisi’s Karimnagar speech of 2013 or the agitation against Taslima Nasreen in 2007), the party’s popularity and electoral successes in recent years do not rest on a radical discourse but operate within the framework of electoral democracy.

However, the question of polarization deserves more discussion. One might indeed wonder whether the AIMIM’s Muslim politics pushed Hindu voters towards the NDA in the 20 constituencies where the AIMIM was contesting. One observation may seem to indicate so: in the 32 constituencies where Muslims form at least 30% of the population, the BJP increased its MLA representation from seven in 2015 to 12 in 2020, winning five new constituencies. Yet, even if a consolidation of the Hindu vote could be ascertained, the causality with the AIMIM’s politics remains unclear, as the BJP has gained new seats in area with little Muslim population as well. Besides, couldn’t this polarization be the result of the long-term political work of other parties and candidates, whether in the NDA or the MGB?
Muslim minority politics: What worked for other winning Muslim candidates?

The AIMIM’s entrance into Bihar politics may be an important step in the party’s expansion beyond its stronghold of Hyderabad. However, as much as it wants to claim representation for all Muslims, in Bihar the AIMIM is responsible for the victory of only five out of a total of 19 Muslims who were elected to the assembly (down from 24 in 2015). This shows that in most of Bihar, where on average Muslims make up about 17% of the population, candidates are unlikely to be elected with a rhetoric of ‘Muslim politics’, because they need to appeal to non-Muslim voters as well. This is true even in constituencies where the Muslim population is above the state average, such as in Madhubani and Dharbhanga districts (where Muslims number more than 30% of the population in several constituencies). In minority areas, even if the AIMIM’s popularity may help its losing candidates stand a few percentage points ahead of the rest — as in Sikta, where the AIMIM candidate won 5% of the votes — its rhetoric cannot place the party in the winning position.

What appears clear from the fate of Muslim candidates is the unambiguous vote against the NDA. None of the 11 Muslim candidates fielded by the JDU were able to win, even in seats with a high Muslim population, such as Sheohar. As a result, the ruling coalition does not count a single Muslim MLA in its ranks.

    Muslim voters identified the JDU not so much as a Bihar-based party that is able to deliver on governance, but as an alliance breaker and an ally of the BJP… 

The JDU’s Muslim candidates, whether in Seemanchal (Araria, Thakurganj, Kochadhaman, and Amour) or elsewhere (such as Sikta, Dharbhanga rural, and Marhaura, or Mahua), all came second or third. The JDU’s five Muslim MLAs in the previous assembly who contested this election also lost. Seats where Muslim JDU candidates had won in 2015 thanks to the RJD-JDU alliance now went to the MGB candidates (Sheohar, Sikta, Thakurganj) or the AIMIM (Jokihat, Kochadhaman). This points to the fact that Muslim voters identified the JDU not so much as a Bihar-based party that is able to deliver on governance, but as an alliance breaker and an ally of the BJP. The anti-NDA stance of Muslim voters also shows in the fact that the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which tried to project itself as an ally of the BJP and an opponent of the JDU, could not get any of its seven Muslim candidates elected.

Among all parties, the RJD retains the largest number of Muslim MLAs (eight, down from 12 in 2015), suggesting that its Muslim-Yadav equation still works efficiently. The party successfully placed Muslim MLAs in five seats where previously a non-Muslim was the incumbent (three from the JDU, one BJP and one independent), and won one constituency from a JDU Muslim MLA. Yet, interestingly, only two of the RJD’s eight Muslim MLAs elected in 2020 are incumbents, which means that the party also lost many constituencies with an incumbent Muslim MLA: eight such seats went to the NDA. While three sitting RJD Muslim MLAs were defeated in their own constituencies, the party incurred the loss of an important figure, Abdul Bari Siddiqui, and could not successfully fill the void left by the death of its four-time MLA Abdul Ghafoor.

The Congress seemed to pursue its long-term association with Muslim elites, by picking candidates who tend to be Ashraf, well-educated, with links with educational centres such as Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) or Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi. The only Congress Muslim candidate from a marginalized Muslim community was Abidur Rahman in Araria, a seat with a strong Kulhaiya presence, and he was re-elected. The Congress had fielded 12 Muslims among its 70 candidates, a higher proportion than other parties. Yet, its candidates were often directly pitted against the BJP rather than the smaller parties, in part explaining its low strike rate. For instance, in the former RJD constituency of Jale, the Congress fielded Mashkoor Ahmad Usmani, a former president of the AMU student’ union. Usmani got more than 65,000 votes (38%) but could not defeat the BJP candidate. However, the Congress’ three incumbent Muslim MLAs showed striking stability and were re-elected.
Muslim identity politics: How does Pasmanda mobilization translate in electoral terms?

Our typology of political dynamics among Muslims is incomplete without mention of caste-based or identity politics.

Bihar stands out as a bastion of caste-based mobilization by marginalized Muslim groups. In particular, the Momin Ansaris, or weavers, have long had organizations working for their collective upliftment and access to politics, such as the Momin Conference, which opposed the Muslim League before Partition and was merged by its leader, Abdul Qayyum Ansari, into the Congress after Independence.

More recently, it is also in Bihar that such mobilization significantly re-emerged in a new form. New organizations now explicitly challenge the leadership of the Ashraf, accusing them of maintaining their dominant position by invoking the necessity for Muslims to unite as a minority community. In the mid-1990s, Ali Anwar launched the Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz, and Ejaz Ali established the Backward Muslim Morcha. While both claimed to represent the Pasmanda — marginalized caste-groups within Muslims — this bifurcation indicates an internal power imbalance: between the numerically larger and politically active Ansaris and the multiple other smaller biradaris (caste groups) who have been side-lined within Pasmanda movements. Yet in the 2000s, both Ali Anwar and Ejaz Ali accepted Rajya Sabha nominations by the JDU, which sought to pull Pasmanda support away from upper caste Muslim candidates fielded by the RJD and the Congress.

As the political campaign picked up momentum ahead of the 2020 Bihar elections, Pasmanda activists published online lists of the Muslim candidates that indicated their biradari. After the results, they were quick to point out the lack of caste diversity among Muslim candidates and elected MLAs. Not only is there a continued over-representation of Ashraf among Muslim candidates and elected MLAs (16 Ashraf against 3 Pasmanda this year), there are also very few biradaris represented of the total number of caste groups. Out of three Ansari candidates picked by the large parties (Anjum Ara of the JDU in Dumraon, Qayamuddin Ansarin of the CPI (ML) in Arrah, and Javed Iqbal Ansari of the RJD in Banka), none managed to emerge victorious.

    Pasmanda politics has not so far proved itself to be an electoral force…the need to vote for a winning candidate against the NDA trumps any possible biradari affinity among Muslims. 

The lack of political representation of the marginalized among the Muslims persists in spite of the creation in 2019 of a new organization that aimed to solve this issue. Invoking the heritage of Abdul Qayyum Ansari, the Ansari Mahapanchayat (AMP) was founded by a young Jamia Millia Islamia graduate from Gaya, Waseem Nayyar Ansari. The AMP’s message is clear and simple: Ansaris represent 11% of Bihar’s population but there is neither an MLA nor an MP from the community. The AMP argues for self-representation in proportion to their population share, as indicated by the slogans “apni qayadat, apni siyasat” (our leadership, our politics), “jiski jitni abadi, utni hissedari” (participation proportional to our population). The AMP launched a ground-level campaign to build a base in central and western Bihar which led to a large gathering in Patna in December 2019, attended by about 3,000-4,000 people and by prominent figures of Pasmanda politics, such as Ali Anwar and Dr. Ayyub, the head of the Peace Party.

Initially claiming to be entirely non-partisan and working exclusively as a lobby for the presence of Ansaris and Pasmanda Muslims, the AMP took a political stand when it opposed the CAA-NRC and joined the Bihar Bandh on 15 December 2019. The AMP hoped to be able to negotiate for as many as 30 or 40 tickets, but its discussion with Congress and RJD fell short of its expectations. It eventually joined the Progressive Democratic Alliance led by Rajesh Ranjan, the veteran politician better known as Pappu Yadav. In fact, the AMP leadership split at that point, with a section accepting the JDU’s promise of Legislative Council seats while Ali Anwar and his Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz expressed support for MGB.

This shows the limits of such caste-based organizations. While they may offer a way of creating a political base for a leader, they are undermined by individual opportunity seekers. They are dependent on the support of larger political organizations to enter the electoral contest, but are often too weak to weigh in on major parties’ arbitrations.

The AMP fielded five Ansari candidates in the elections, who received between 1,000 and 3,500 votes. In spite of this poor performance, one might argue that being able to enter an alliance with a well-known personality, field several candidates from the community, and gain the following of several thousand people, was quite a step for a new initiative. Nonetheless, Pasmanda politics has not so far proved itself to be an electoral force. In the minority context, the need to vote for a winning candidate against the NDA trumps any possible biradari affinity among Muslims.
Conclusions

If the 2020 Bihar election did about bring some changes to minority politics, other long-standing trends are still at work in the shaping of state-level politics. The AIMIM’s push on the basis of a rhetoric of Muslim politics is significant but does not tell the whole story. The RJD’s Muslim-Yadav equation is still efficient. The Congress still seeks to co-opt Muslim elites. In spite of recent mobilizations, Pasmanda politics has not been able to make a dent in electoral dynamics but can be a good way for someone with political ambitions to enter the political arena. Finally, the overarching voting trend among Muslim voters, whether in majority or minority contexts, or among marginalized Muslim communities, remains a strong will to defeat the candidates of the BJP and its allies.

Muslim (majority) politics: The AIMIM’s foray in Seemanchal

When looking at Muslim political participation in Bihar, one of the interesting characteristics of the state is that it includes both Muslim minority and majority (or near-majority) areas. This leads to two distinct political dynamics. In areas where they are not in a majority, Muslims seem subject to a kind of minority syndrome and thus more concerned with security than with collective assertion. In the Muslim majority areas, on the other hand, a space opens up for ‘Muslim politics’, that is, a political discourse that stresses the need for Muslims to be politically represented on their own terms and to voice community-specific concerns. The AIMIM’s and Asaduddin Owaisi’s politics fall into this category. Owaisi explicitly states the need for ‘Muslim politics’, as for instance in this interview: “The realization among Bihar Muslims and everywhere is that we require an independent political voice.” This worked well this time in Seemanchal, where in 13 constituencies Muslims account for at least 40% of the population. Yet Seemanchal is not new to Muslim politics. Syed Shahabuddin, the editor of Muslim India and a prominent voice on ‘Muslim issues’ — from the Shah Bano case to the destruction of the Babri Masjid — had for instance won the Lok Sabha seat of Kishanganj in 1991.

While the AIMIM has made its entrance in Bihar in the latest elections, its candidates are also not new to politics, but are professional politicians. The party’s anti-BJP rhetoric that invoked the charged atmosphere of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests fostered wide popularity among Muslim youth. Yet the comfortable margins the AIMIM achieved in the five constituencies it won — Amour, Kochadhaman, Jokihat, Baisi and Bahadurgunj — could hardly have been possible without candidates with political experience.

[T]he local standing of candidates was crucial for the AIMIM’s victories in Bihar. 

The main organizer of the AIMIM in Bihar, Akhtarul Iman — who won in Amour with a margin of 52,000 votes — had been a Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MLA between 2005 and 2014. The winner in Bahadurganj, Anzar Naeemi, had been candidate on a RJD ticket in 2010 and joined the AIMIM only in August 2020. In Jokihat, the contest was a family affair. Shahnawaz Alam, the son of eight-time MLA and one-time MP Muhammad Tasleemuddin, was contesting against his elder brother, Sarfaraz Alam of the RJD, who had been elected three times to the assembly seat (with the RJD in 2000 and then the Janata Dal (United), or JDU, in 2010 and 2015) and once to a parliamentary seat in a by-election (with the RJD in 2018). In Baisi, Syed Ruknuddin Ahmad had previously won as an independent in 2005 and had later joined the JDU. And in Kochadhaman, the winner, Muhammad Izhar Asfi, had been a panchayat mukhiya (head) and an old associate of Akhtarul Iman. Asfi also happened to unseat his own son-in-law, four-time Congress MLA Tausif Alam.

Thus, the local standing of candidates was crucial for the AIMIM’s victories in Bihar — combined with the popularity of Asaduddin Owaisi and Akhtarul Iman, and, in some places, a subtle balance between local dominant communities. The AIMIM had to appeal to Seemanchal’s two largest social groups among Muslims. The Surjapuris — considered to be Shaikh and therefore part of the dominant Ashraf cluster — are in large numbers in Kishanganj district, while the marginalized Kulhaiya — who were included in the category of Extremely Backward Classes created by Nitish Kumar’s government in 2005 — constitute a significant group in Araria district. The AIMIM’s winning candidates hail from the numerically dominant community of their respective constituencies: Surjapuri Shaikh for Akhtarul Iman, Anzar Naeemi, and Izhar Asfi in Kishanganj and Purnia districts, and Kulhaiya for Shahnawaz Alam in Araria district. To help the AIMIM candidates win over the Kulhaiya vote, Shahnawaz Alam campaigned with them in their constituencies. Finally, the AIMIM’s fifth MLA, in Baisi, is a Sayyid — the highest social group among Muslims that claims descent from Prophet Muhammad — whose family has long been integrated with the Surjapuri environment.

In none of the constituencies where the NDA won and the MGB came in second place did the AIMIM obtain a vote share greater than the winning party’s margin. 

The AIMIM’s rise in Seemanchal attracted media attention and much condemnation from the Congress party and the RJD. The role of ‘kingmaker’ that some analysts expected the party to play did not materialize — the AIMIM’s five seats were not enough to help the Mahagathbandhan (MGB) form a majority, were it indeed to join the alliance. Yet accusations of the AIMIM being responsible for the MGB’s failure to win enough seats to form the government were repeatedly expressed. The allegation, however, does not hold upon closer analysis. In none of the constituencies where the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won and the MGB came in second place did the AIMIM obtain a vote share greater than the winning party’s margin. In other words, the fact that the AIMIM contested these seats did not siphon off enough votes from the MGB to be responsible for its defeat.

The more elaborate construction of the ‘vote katwa’ (vote cutting) or ‘BJP ki B team’ (BJP’s B team) allegation targets Owaisi’s rhetoric of Muslim politics and questions his commitment to secularism and democracy.

In spite of the AIMIM’s past and the occasional radical actions of some of its members … the party’s popularity and electoral successes in recent years do not rest on a radical discourse but operate within the framework of electoral democracy. 

On the night of the election results, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera held that Owaisi’s politics spark radicalization among Muslim youth by seeking to counter the BJP’s radical discourse. Khera spoke of a “mutually reinforced radicalization” that makes Owaisi a “partner with right-wing radicalization”. This idea blames Owaisi for participating in Hindu-Muslim polarization on an equal footing with the BJP, supposedly contributing to bolstering politicians with majoritarian claims and side-lining the potential weight of Muslim voters. Yet this accusation confusingly blends two processes: radicalization and polarization. In spite of the AIMIM’s past and the occasional radical actions of some of its members (Akbaruddin Owaisi’s Karimnagar speech of 2013 or the agitation against Taslima Nasreen in 2007), the party’s popularity and electoral successes in recent years do not rest on a radical discourse but operate within the framework of electoral democracy.

However, the question of polarization deserves more discussion. One might indeed wonder whether the AIMIM’s Muslim politics pushed Hindu voters towards the NDA in the 20 constituencies where the AIMIM was contesting. One observation may seem to indicate so: in the 32 constituencies where Muslims form at least 30% of the population, the BJP increased its MLA representation from seven in 2015 to 12 in 2020, winning five new constituencies. Yet, even if a consolidation of the Hindu vote could be ascertained, the causality with the AIMIM’s politics remains unclear, as the BJP has gained new seats in area with little Muslim population as well. Besides, couldn’t this polarization be the result of the long-term political work of other parties and candidates, whether in the NDA or the MGB? Muslim minority politics: What worked for other winning Muslim candidates?

The AIMIM’s entrance into Bihar politics may be an important step in the party’s expansion beyond its stronghold of Hyderabad. However, as much as it wants to claim representation for all Muslims, in Bihar the AIMIM is responsible for the victory of only five out of a total of 19 Muslims who were elected to the assembly (down from 24 in 2015). This shows that in most of Bihar, where on average Muslims make up about 17% of the population, candidates are unlikely to be elected with a rhetoric of ‘Muslim politics’, because they need to appeal to non-Muslim voters as well. This is true even in constituencies where the Muslim population is above the state average, such as in Madhubani and Dharbhanga districts (where Muslims number more than 30% of the population in several constituencies). In minority areas, even if the AIMIM’s popularity may help its losing candidates stand a few percentage points ahead of the rest — as in Sikta, where the AIMIM candidate won 5% of the votes — its rhetoric cannot place the party in the winning position.

What appears clear from the fate of Muslim candidates is the unambiguous vote against the NDA. None of the 11 Muslim candidates fielded by the JDU were able to win, even in seats with a high Muslim population, such as Sheohar. As a result, the ruling coalition does not count a single Muslim MLA in its ranks.

Muslim voters identified the JDU not so much as a Bihar-based party that is able to deliver on governance, but as an alliance breaker and an ally of the BJP… 

The JDU’s Muslim candidates, whether in Seemanchal (Araria, Thakurganj, Kochadhaman, and Amour) or elsewhere (such as Sikta, Dharbhanga rural, and Marhaura, or Mahua), all came second or third. The JDU’s five Muslim MLAs in the previous assembly who contested this election also lost. Seats where Muslim JDU candidates had won in 2015 thanks to the RJD-JDU alliance now went to the MGB candidates (Sheohar, Sikta, Thakurganj) or the AIMIM (Jokihat, Kochadhaman). This points to the fact that Muslim voters identified the JDU not so much as a Bihar-based party that is able to deliver on governance, but as an alliance breaker and an ally of the BJP. The anti-NDA stance of Muslim voters also shows in the fact that the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which tried to project itself as an ally of the BJP and an opponent of the JDU, could not get any of its seven Muslim candidates elected.

Among all parties, the RJD retains the largest number of Muslim MLAs (eight, down from 12 in 2015), suggesting that its Muslim-Yadav equation still works efficiently. The party successfully placed Muslim MLAs in five seats where previously a non-Muslim was the incumbent (three from the JDU, one BJP and one independent), and won one constituency from a JDU Muslim MLA. Yet, interestingly, only two of the RJD’s eight Muslim MLAs elected in 2020 are incumbents, which means that the party also lost many constituencies with an incumbent Muslim MLA: eight such seats went to the NDA. While three sitting RJD Muslim MLAs were defeated in their own constituencies, the party incurred the loss of an important figure, Abdul Bari Siddiqui, and could not successfully fill the void left by the death of its four-time MLA Abdul Ghafoor.

The Congress seemed to pursue its long-term association with Muslim elites, by picking candidates who tend to be Ashraf, well-educated, with links with educational centres such as Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) or Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi. The only Congress Muslim candidate from a marginalized Muslim community was Abidur Rahman in Araria, a seat with a strong Kulhaiya presence, and he was re-elected. The Congress had fielded 12 Muslims among its 70 candidates, a higher proportion than other parties. Yet, its candidates were often directly pitted against the BJP rather than the smaller parties, in part explaining its low strike rate. For instance, in the former RJD constituency of Jale, the Congress fielded Mashkoor Ahmad Usmani, a former president of the AMU student’ union. Usmani got more than 65,000 votes (38%) but could not defeat the BJP candidate. However, the Congress’ three incumbent Muslim MLAs showed striking stability and were re-elected. Muslim identity politics: How does Pasmanda mobilization translate in electoral terms?

Our typology of political dynamics among Muslims is incomplete without mention of caste-based or identity politics.

Bihar stands out as a bastion of caste-based mobilization by marginalized Muslim groups. In particular, the Momin Ansaris, or weavers, have long had organizations working for their collective upliftment and access to politics, such as the Momin Conference, which opposed the Muslim League before Partition and was merged by its leader, Abdul Qayyum Ansari, into the Congress after Independence.

More recently, it is also in Bihar that such mobilization significantly re-emerged in a new form. New organizations now explicitly challenge the leadership of the Ashraf, accusing them of maintaining their dominant position by invoking the necessity for Muslims to unite as a minority community. In the mid-1990s, Ali Anwar launched the Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz, and Ejaz Ali established the Backward Muslim Morcha. While both claimed to represent the Pasmanda — marginalized caste-groups within Muslims — this bifurcation indicates an internal power imbalance: between the numerically larger and politically active Ansaris and the multiple other smaller biradaris (caste groups) who have been side-lined within Pasmanda movements. Yet in the 2000s, both Ali Anwar and Ejaz Ali accepted Rajya Sabha nominations by the JDU, which sought to pull Pasmanda support away from upper caste Muslim candidates fielded by the RJD and the Congress.

As the political campaign picked up momentum ahead of the 2020 Bihar elections, Pasmanda activists published online lists of the Muslim candidates that indicated their biradari. After the results, they were quick to point out the lack of caste diversity among Muslim candidates and elected MLAs. Not only is there a continued over-representation of Ashraf among Muslim candidates and elected MLAs (16 Ashraf against 3 Pasmanda this year), there are also very few biradaris represented of the total number of caste groups. Out of three Ansari candidates picked by the large parties (Anjum Ara of the JDU in Dumraon, Qayamuddin Ansarin of the CPI (ML) in Arrah, and Javed Iqbal Ansari of the RJD in Banka), none managed to emerge victorious.

Pasmanda politics has not so far proved itself to be an electoral force…the need to vote for a winning candidate against the NDA trumps any possible biradari affinity among Muslims. 

The lack of political representation of the marginalized among the Muslims persists in spite of the creation in 2019 of a new organization that aimed to solve this issue. Invoking the heritage of Abdul Qayyum Ansari, the Ansari Mahapanchayat (AMP) was founded by a young Jamia Millia Islamia graduate from Gaya, Waseem Nayyar Ansari. The AMP’s message is clear and simple: Ansaris represent 11% of Bihar’s population but there is neither an MLA nor an MP from the community. The AMP argues for self-representation in proportion to their population share, as indicated by the slogans “apni qayadat, apni siyasat” (our leadership, our politics), “jiski jitni abadi, utni hissedari” (participation proportional to our population). The AMP launched a ground-level campaign to build a base in central and western Bihar which led to a large gathering in Patna in December 2019, attended by about 3,000-4,000 people and by prominent figures of Pasmanda politics, such as Ali Anwar and Dr. Ayyub, the head of the Peace Party.

Initially claiming to be entirely non-partisan and working exclusively as a lobby for the presence of Ansaris and Pasmanda Muslims, the AMP took a political stand when it opposed the CAA-NRC and joined the Bihar Bandh on 15 December 2019. The AMP hoped to be able to negotiate for as many as 30 or 40 tickets, but its discussion with Congress and RJD fell short of its expectations. It eventually joined the Progressive Democratic Alliance led by Rajesh Ranjan, the veteran politician better known as Pappu Yadav. In fact, the AMP leadership split at that point, with a section accepting the JDU’s promise of Legislative Council seats while Ali Anwar and his Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz expressed support for MGB.

This shows the limits of such caste-based organizations. While they may offer a way of creating a political base for a leader, they are undermined by individual opportunity seekers. They are dependent on the support of larger political organizations to enter the electoral contest, but are often too weak to weigh in on major parties’ arbitrations.

The AMP fielded five Ansari candidates in the elections, who received between 1,000 and 3,500 votes. In spite of this poor performance, one might argue that being able to enter an alliance with a well-known personality, field several candidates from the community, and gain the following of several thousand people, was quite a step for a new initiative. Nonetheless, Pasmanda politics has not so far proved itself to be an electoral force. In the minority context, the need to vote for a winning candidate against the NDA trumps any possible biradari affinity among Muslims. Conclusions

If the 2020 Bihar election did about bring some changes to minority politics, other long-standing trends are still at work in the shaping of state-level politics. The AIMIM’s push on the basis of a rhetoric of Muslim politics is significant but does not tell the whole story. The RJD’s Muslim-Yadav equation is still efficient. The Congress still seeks to co-opt Muslim elites. In spite of recent mobilizations, Pasmanda politics has not been able to make a dent in electoral dynamics but can be a good way for someone with political ambitions to enter the political arena. Finally, the overarching voting trend among Muslim voters, whether in majority or minority contexts, or among marginalized Muslim communities, remains a strong will to defeat the candidates of the BJP and its allies.

Strengthening Early Warning Systems to track at-risk students
Overview
IDinsight is working with the British Asian Trust and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to strengthen their Early Warning Systems to track students who are at risk of dropping out of schools. This ongoing partnership entails supporting the PMU in DCPCR in effectively monitoring and overseeing the delivery of the EWS programme, with the ultimate goal of leveraging the system to increase retention of children in the education system. 
About the Early Warning System 
Early Warning System is a DCPCR project, launched in March 2022 in collaboration with the Directorate of Education, Delhi Government. It tracks attendance data to identify students at risk of dropping out, and intervene with remedial interventions to bring them back to schools.
According to 2019 data, nearly 5 lakh children are absent in Delhi Govt schools on any given day. The model of Early Warning System is based on the understanding that a substantially low school attendance of a student is possibly a result of certain circumstances (such as sickness, abuse) which has forced the child out of school. 
The system relies on the daily online attendance marked by teachers on the Department of Education’s portal. This covers 1075 DoE schools, targeting ~1.8 million children enrolled in GNCTD schools. Daily attendance of these students are tracked and based on pre decided criterias, a child is detected at risk. Once detected, DCPCR intervenes by reaching out to students through their helpline (SMS, IVRS, phone call) or home visits with the help of school management committees, civil society organizations. During these calls and home visits, based on the reasons for absence identified through these interventions, children are given serious cases fr absenteesims such as child labour, trafficking, marriage, relevant departments immediately intervenes and provide relevant support. (Refer to exhibit A to see the EWS flow). 










Exhibit A: EWS process flow

How is IDinsight supporting this?
IDinsight is supporting DCPCR and BAT in strengthening the existing EWS model and improving their monitoring systems. Our assessment has identified several inefficiencies in the system, which reduce the potential impact of the programme. Using a holistic approach that addresses end-to-end  delivery inefficiencies, we aim to drive three levels of impact: 
Increased detection of vulnerable children by increasing intervention coverage and improving the detection criteria. An internal estimation projects that by increasing the coverage of phone call interventions from 25% to 50%+ and automating the back-end process for identification of serious cases, we could see a 2x increase in detection of child labour cases, providing timely remedial interventions. 


Improved monitoring and correction of programme implementation bottlenecks,  thereby reducing any exclusion errors and resolving any breakages in the detection and redressal system on a real-time basis. 

Ultimately, tracking and improving outcomes of increased child retention in schools (bringing more children back to school, and sooner while retaining them longer) and speedier resolution/rehabilitation for children experiencing any form of abuse. 


Work progress:
The EWS plays a vital role in identifying students at risk of dropping out of school and providing them with timely interventions. Over the past months, IDinsight has been working on the EWS, improving the data monitoring systems and conducting analysis on programme effectiveness. Some of this work includes:   
Identifying reasons for absence among children by geographical location: We analyzed attendance and intervention data to identify pockets of higher absenteeism and reasons for absence. 
This aided BAT PMU and DCPCR in targeting the right interventions based on the reasons and prioritizing regions which are at greater risk. 

Strengthening the EWS monitoring system: We identified priority indicators and developed periodic review bulletins assessing programme’s effectiveness. Sharing insights on outcome indicators such as students at-risk of dropping out, intervention coverage and back to school students as a result of EWS interventions for PMU to take informed action.

Streamlined data collection processes: We improved and restructured their call interventions, providing recommendations and support for automating processes, removing redundancies. This enabled PMU to increase their intervention coverage. 

Revising detection criteria: EWS has tracked students attendance and detects at-risk students based on a detection criteria. IDinsight is testing out various criterias and conducting an optimisation exercise to identify best suited criteria given the intervention capacity. This would help in improved accurate detection of at-risk students.

Some snippets from our analysis:  


Appendix (if information needed on DCPCR):
DCPCR: As a regulatory body, it has the administrative power to take actions for protecting the rights of over six million children residing in the National Capital Territory of Delhi. DCPCR drives this mandate through programmes such as the  Early Warning System (targeted at 1.8 million children enrolled in GNCTD schools), Grievance Redressal System, (targeted to over 5.5 million children resident in Delhi) and Juvenile Justice Management System. DCPCR in addition also facilitates programmes on child welfare, health and nutrition, education and legal protections.
Early Warning System: Descriptive analysis of data from the Early Warning System pointed to gaps in the system, which led to the uptake of the recommendation to  introduce  new indicators in the system (for eg: “date on which child returns to school”) that enables a better understanding of the efficacy of the EWS programme. The analysis also pointed to the need for a consistent monitoring format and a revision of the calling protocol, recommendations that are currently being taken up by the PMU.

Literature suggests that dropout rates of online courses can be significantly affected by external factors besides the quality and features of the courses. These include learners finding the cognitive load of the course to be much higher than they expected, social and family factors, motivational factors, technological constraints, etc. Non-completion of CBPs may also be because many learners pursue most modules/resources but do not fully complete the CBP because of their unwillingness to complete optional assignments, case studies, or capstone projects. So, while it is rare that a CBP will have all enrolled learners completing the CBP; it is possible that some CBPs witness dropouts at the early stages while others witness dropouts very late into the CBP.",PROJECTS

 thanks for the chat earlier today.
I wanted to follow-up with some resources around Impact Evaluation Design documents. The corresponding HUB page is here. It has a draft template, check-list etc. for what this document usually contains. There are also a bunch of examples of documents here. I particularly like the older piece here.
As discussed, we won't be able to fill in all of the sections at this point. so could leave placeholders and/or capture bullet points of what would be captured here and what aspects we should be aware of.
The sections that we can start to populate are:
Background/Motivation (will be largely similar to the RfP for partners)
Program description: a rough overview of the interventions we plan to test.
Research Questions: we discussed today the spectrum of questions that is possible:
all interventions as a package,
test all/some interventions against each other,
test smaller packages of interventions.
As part of this description, I would also like to understand which interventions are possible to implement on an individual vs group/clustered-level. I am foreseeing sth like a nice overview table of these interventions that quick provides an glimpse of what they aim at achieving, where and how we'd classify them (stage of program: design, monitoring, ...; cost/level of effort, cluster/individual; etc) I am sure you have thought about these aspects quite a bit already. 
Sample size calculations: this will largely depend on 3 - and we can run different scenarios. As mentioned, I am keen to understand whether this is sth that 
@Dilshad S
 is interested in getting exposure to. I have also reached out to Dhananjay to see which JEs may be available to support/supervise this work.
Costs: This is not sth that we have usually in the IE design document, but I suggest that we start thinking about a budget. This should take into account both the cost of data collection as well as the cost of implementing the intervention. Have you discussed with Tom, how the team was thinking about covering operating expenditures for the partner-org? Ideally, there's some interest to co-fund this work, but I understand that the available budget may be covering both research + implementation. That correct?

use this text to summarize ask a metric in 100 words:
Ask-a-metric
The main way decision-makers engage with data is through dashboards. But this requires looking at another screen and navigating to the data point of interest. Senior officials may not have the time or the inclination to engage with a dashboard.
We propose “Ask-a-metric” (AAM). Decision-makers would be able to query metrics using natural language in the messaging service of their choice. This would increase the use of data in decision-making by meeting the decision-makers where they are.

An example 

  Decision-maker (DM): How many districts have lower than 50% institutional deliveries?
  Ask-a-metric (AAM): There are 5 districts with less than 50% delivery. Would you like me to list   them?
  DM: Yes
  AAM: They are <D1>, <D2>, <D3>, <D4>, <D5>
  DM: What is the percentage for <D7>?
  AAM: 68% of the births in <D7> are institutional deliveries.


See example here.
Solution Details
We will build an LLM application that will allow users from authorized numbers to ask questions over whatsapp / viber or other messaging service that they are already using.
It will have conversation capability
As shown in the example below, the AAM understands that we are still talking about “institutional deliveries” when the DM asked about <D7>. 
The DM is able to refine or alter the question while not having to repeat the full context.
It will track feedback
It will ask the user if their question was answered. We can track the kinds of questions decision-maker are asking - it will identify gaps in the metrics and inform future data collection efforts.
It will allow for voice memos
Too busy to type? Record a voice memo and send it in. Response can be both voice or text.
It can be deployed to different front-ends
Viber may be big in one country while Whatsapp dominates in another. Solution can be easily deployed on different platforms. Future extensions could also be a web page front-end.
Offer as an add-on service
We can offer this as an add-on service on all our MEL engagements. We will build this as a product that connects to our usual tech-stack which means that the cost of deploying this on a new project will be nominal.

Consider more targeted outreach for program participants from Dalit, religious minority, LGBTQA+, and other marginalized communities. Based on the assumptions prioritisation activity, lack of representation in programs of participants from Dalit, religious minority, and LGBTQA+ communities is a risk. We also know from the Evidence Review that life skills programs often struggle to reach the most marginalized girls, who face mobility constraints.



Organizational resources



Consider improving processes for retaining staff in management positions. We learnt in the assumptions prioritisation activity that the current level of turnover might hurt program execution. Turnover in organizations might occur for a variety of reasons, such as burnout, low pay, lack of professional growth, and - as Azad team has specified - ill health. What are Azad team’s key reasons for turnover? What is the extent of turnover? Is turnover concentrated in certain positions? What approaches has  Azad team experimented with or wants to explore in future address turnover? If the problem is significant, Azad team may want to consider increasing resource allocation to address this issue..



Consider improving  processes for hiring and training mobilizers, trainers, and driving faculty. In the assumptions prioritization activity, we learnt that mobilizers, trainers, and driving faculty may not always have the right tools and expertise to conduct their activities. Azad team specified the risks that mobilizers do not build sufficient rapport with communities, trainers are not gender-sensitive, and/or driving faculty are not up-to-date on training material. What are the extents of these challenges? Do team members need longer, more frequent, or different training? Do they need closer monitoring? Does Azad team need to change selection criteria in the hiring process or is retention a greater challenge? 



Improve linkages between high-quality MIS and program decision-making. In the assumptions prioritisation activity, Azad team specified the risk that monitoring data does not feed optimally into program changes. This concern will be the core of the next phase of our engagement. We will focus on improving monitoring metrics and then improving the organizational processes which link these metrics to program decision-making.

IDinsight’s support to SHOFCO by developing an excellent data system and MEL plan as a foundation for rapid growth in the next 2-5 years, enables SHOFCO to maximize their learnings and impact for slum-dwellers. Currently, IDinsight is working with SHOFCO to scope and develop a MEL framework and data system for 8 SHOFCO programs and a number of other deliverables. 
Azad Foundation: IDinsight has a continued engagement with Azad Foundation, an organization that provides non-traditional livelihoods for resource-poor women in urban areas of India. Azad Foundation's Women With Wheels program has trained over 1,800 women as chauffeurs, with around 1,000 successfully employed in this role. They also run education programs, advocate for policy change, and invest in leadership skills for adolescent girls.  Outputs from this 4-month engagement included a refined Theory of Change, evidence review of programs enhancing women and girls' agency, program strategy recommendations, priority indicators, and recommendations for improving the overall data system. IDinsight's support facilitated internal alignment within Azad Foundation's leadership on program impacts and pathways. Our strategy recommendations contributed to Azad Foundation's five-year strategic review, informing program priorities. Additionally, our indicator recommendations helped Azad Foundation conceptualize a more rigorous measurement approach for improving women and girls' agency.

Milaan’s follow up 


Email body


Dear Dihrendra, 
Thank you for your note and inputs. Please find our responses to each of the questions below: 
Team profiles: Given the project based model of the firm and a dynamic pipeline, we reserve staff for a project close to signing of the actual contract and do not make specific allocations during the initial stages. However, we are attaching with this email profiles of our teammates across levels (Director, Manager and Associate) that can give you an idea about the background and skill set of people who are likely to be staffed on this M&E advisory work. 


M&E capacity building for Milaan team[a]: We expect to build the capacity of the program and M&E team through this engagement (page 6 of the proposal talks about it in more detail). Instead of dedicated capacity building sessions, we’ll take a participatory approach wherein the M&E framework is co-created by IDi and relevant teams at Milaan.

We also know from the Evidence Review that life skills programs often struggle to reach the most marginalized girls, who face mobility constraints.



ORGANIZATIONAL RESOURCES

Consider improving processes for retaining staff in management positions. We learnt in the assumptions prioritisation activity that the current level of turnover might hurt program execution. Turnover in organizations might occur for a variety of reasons, such as burnout, low pay, lack of professional growth, and - as Azad team has specified - ill health. What are Azad team’s key reasons for turnover? What is the extent of turnover? Is turnover concentrated in certain positions? What approaches has Azad team experimented with or wants to explore in future address turnover? If the problem is significant, Azad team may want to consider allocating more resources to address this issue.



Consider improving processes for hiring and training mobilizers, trainers, and driving faculty. In the assumptions prioritisation activity, we learnt that mobilizers, trainers, and driving faculty may not always have the right tools and expertise to conduct their activities. Azad team specified the risks that mobilizers do not build sufficient rapport with communities, trainers are not gender-sensitive, and/or driving faculty are not up-to-date on training material. What are the extents of these challenges? Do team members need longer, more frequent, or different training? Do they need closer monitoring? Does Azad team need to change selection criteria in the hiring process, or is retention a greater challenge? 



Improve linkages between high-quality MIS and program decision-making. In the assumptions prioritisation activity, Azad team specified the risk that monitoring data does not feed optimally into program changes. This concern will be the core of the next phase of our engagement. We will focus on improving monitoring metrics and then improving the organizational processes which link these metrics to program decision-making.

Increased involvement for Pratham International is expected after training. We don't have local team members who can work from there.






Notes

Divya: can ask ministry to send mentors

Usha: …
absentee rate of students

Can teachers stick to activities, as per methodology.

Classroom processes

Anjor: difficulties facing while giving training, related to content, about activities
are teachers facing difficulty while conducting TaRL classes

Kairav: deep dive visit. Pick 10 schools and ask qs, can also ask to students

How many classes have taken place across board? Fill during assessment data

Divya: ID insight collected some data on perceptions about teacher training. Can we repeat, or avoid

Meera: 

Kairav: figure out larger qs first.

Divya: coordination with minister for teacher training

Some sort of traingulation between ministry’s understanding of model and implementation, and sanady’s

Kiarav: missing in the training from teachers? Test on some aspects of training

Divya: test ministry officials, coordination aspect of certification

Indresh: focus and max time on which part of training, on what basis prepared training agenda, help to understand ID insight’s findings

Exact reason for delays in classes? Maybe provide kit to develop material unless other material reaches you during training, classroom management particularly during grouping

Meera: can we compare classroom observation with assessment data? Which activites are being repeated, are activities selected in proper way, 

Indresh: done similar activity for learning lab, Anjali can help

Divya: first time RCT on these two languages, focus is not on classroom methodology eventually we will need something to explain learning outcomes

Using Arabic to teach French

Get into more detailed sessions for sessions planning, give mock data or video to get them into action to understand connection 

Anjor: Can we also ask how they are using videos that they have developed? And what impact have these videos bought in class/training?

Divya: best mechanism to coordinate with ministry to supplement ngo led model? Technical and logistical, national and regional. Agreement from ministry may be required?

Meera: how to work with other ngos, collective training, role of sanady

Usha: same model as sanady follows? What will be sandy’s role

Divya: sanady wanted to be strategic partner, can ask that clarification on email. Perhaps become technical lead

Tanya: Quality of review meetings and value addition of mentoring

Meera: certification responsibility might remain with us only.

FINAL QUERY:
Please summarize the following content into 5-6 takeaways. Use simple and easy-to-understand language. Please list each takeaway as points and use at least 30 words for each takeaway.

In the pursuit of aligning with the Karmayogi guidelines, various stakeholders provided insights that collectively underscore the necessity for a robust and resourceful ecosystem to enhance the effectiveness of academic and administrative functions. 
The Academy pinpointed the importance of adequate human, financial, and temporal resources to foster institutional growth and better utilise existing systems and tools like the annual capacity building plan. While the course topics are currently not organized based on domain, functional, and behavioural competencies, the Academy displayed an inclination towards doing this in the future to facilitate more targeted and measurable training. 
In addition, there is an urgent demand and need for more systematic professional development, with current efforts being too infrequent. While faculty members are highly knowledgeable and qualified, they will benefit greatly from targeted, hands-on training in adult learning principles and effective methods of communication. At present, a large fraction of the faculty’s understanding of such principles has developed through experimentation and trial and error.
While trial and error is a useful technique, adult learning principles must be inculcated among the faculty in a dedicated and focused manner. Thus, faculty development programs should impart principles and tools that help the faculty involve participants in the learning process, design hands-on exercises, connect classroom theory with the trainees’ work, and foster an environment that enables collaboration and idea-sharing. 
The attachments and collaborations with prestigious academies and institutions, including the National Law School of India University (NLSIU), the Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM), the Indian Institute of Management - Bangalore (IIM-B), and the Indian Institute of Management - Lucknow (IIM-L), are seen to add value to the trainees’ learning experience. Opportunities to sustain and expand such collaborations in newer and emerging topics should be explored.

VB: Happy that they are asking for something that is encapsulated into one spreadsheet. This layout may be of more relevance for the audience laid out this way. Improve the reputability of sources. Medium may have been sparingly cited. More credible sources of Top 1000 journals. Good to align with, knowing that the use case will be higher. INdicators sources may not be available for all indicators, such as % of women in leadership. This may be closer to the scaling up of UN SDGs indicators. Directive: This area is a quant niche that may not always be available. Keep the sources and do a deeper dive to align with more reputable journals. 




MM: How do we make sure it is useful?
VB: Group indicators into themes/groups as much as possible. Use quick visual formatting. Use a diagram that summarizes the ToC and what the indicators are to ensure user friendliness. 




MM: How can we take the work further? How can we test compendium and/or continue to engage grantees? Is it worthwhile to think about this?
VB: It feels like a different type of work to help grantees and test cases. 
RL: Proposing both. Have the compendium as a knowledge product, and workshopping the product to be used more widely. 




MM: what is it that we need to measure more dynamically are those aspects that …. In the indicators. How well are they being mapped into our indicators? This was an aspect very important to see for Iris in terms of standardizing processes and how they scale up to timeliness in how we see impact on indicators. 




VB: Do we have good visibility of MLE activities of the (14?) grantees activities? All: No. Suggestions: Propose working with an organization in each pillar and closely tailor what is in the framework to this. 
RL: Focuses on the importance of specificity while still creating a broader balance between work amongst grantees. 
MM: We would ideally focus on the universe of possibilities with this output. 
RL: Perhaps focus on longer term outcomes and leveling up from them. 




SS: Runs through the 
MM: Suggestion to splice the ToC. 
VB: Reiterates to consider visual representation of the indicators and an introduction to the spreadsheet. 
RL: Lakshmi cited that “The objective of the compendium would be to provide a reference catalogue of definitions, indicators, and measures that WIL partners and external stakeholders could reference to measure interventions aiming impact women’s leadership.  We expect that a resource like this will fill an important gap in the field and can be a valuable guide to help align the measurement approaches of those working in the field.”








Section on Data Collection and Analysis:
MM: (Proposal) Have some selection subsets of indicators and unpack them and use these to navigate the dynamics of data collection and analysis.
RL: Propose and explain that it will be an additional service, and leverage as suggestion of work we will be doing. 
VB: (Caution) Sounds a lot like a data collection manual. Have worked around these before: If detail too granular, it becomes too tedious for user friendliness, of detail too high level, it is not useful. 
SS: (Suggestion) Fill in with Case Studies.
All: Think around this section further. 
VB: Consider skipping this ongoing exercise. Categorize the indicators by themes. Highlight the different outcomes and impacts. 




Section on Stakeholder Engagement:
SS: This section can form the basis of the next stage of engagement with stakeholders in workshops et al. 
VB: Can be combined with processes on M&E advisorship that come with concepts. 
RL: Possibility of engagement at validation; work with the grantee organizations.








MM: Proposal of Draft 2 Page:
Start off with what we have, and what is needed to be done in those arrears.
Close it ioff with staff timing and work. 
Highlight clear outputs on what we will be handing over. 




MM: Spoke to Finance. 395,000 of the budget used, 390,000 left over.

It’s led me down the path of realising that masculinity and feminity are not confined to the male of female figure, but more so energies that have healthy and unhealthy expression. A lot of what we experience of men is broken masculinity at play, and a lack of balance in their feminine and masuline energies. I mean the unhealthyness and unbalance is also somethign that play out in women as well.

Introduction: Main Objective of the Review
Zambia is facing a severe and prolonged blood shortage, with the proportion of blood needs met from collections declining from 80% in 2013 to just 28% in 2022. This trend is driven by several factors, including increased demand for blood to cover new specialized services such as open-heart surgery and a low number of regular volunteer blood donors. Further, the government has increased the country’s blood unit target from 180,000 to 400,000 units, representing 2% of Zambia’s population. This literature review aims to understand better how countries in contexts comparable to Zambia have navigated similar challenges in blood donor recruitment and retention, as well as gain insights into factors influencing blood donation, including national blood policies and clinical uses of blood and blood products.
Overview of Blood Donation
The blood donation landscape differs between high-income and low-income countries. In high income contexts, about 95% of blood donation is done by voluntary non-remunerated donors who recieve no monetary compensation (WHO 2021a). In comparison, only 63% of donations came from voluntary donors in low-income countries, with the remaining contributions coming from family or friends donating directly to a patient who needs blood (WHO 2021a; Asamoah‐Akuoko et al. 2017). The WHO advocates for 100% of a country’s blood donations to come from voluntary donors. When blood donations primarily come from volunteers, a country has a more consistent blood supply as the volume of donations does not have to rely on family or friends or immediate patient needs. Volunteer donors are recognized as the safest source of blood as they are motivated by altruism or social responsibility. Assuming they are not pressured by hospital staff or community members, they have less reason to withhold information about their medical history or lifestyle that would make them ineligible to donate blood (WHO 2010). 
Whole blood is typically collected from donors and broken down into useful components. These components include red cell concentrate (RCC), platelet concentrate (PC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and cryoprecipitate. Each product is valuable in different clinical settings. Therefore, separating and correctly administering blood components is essential in maximizing the impact of blood supply (Barro et al. 2018). Each Provincial Blood Transfusion Centre in Zambia can process whole blood into these components, but capacity has been limited (Zambia MoH 2022).
It is usual for a small percentage of blood donations to be discarded due to transfusion-transmissible infections, processing problems, or other reasons. In 2018, about 4% of donations from high-income countries were discarded, while 10% were discarded in low-income countries (WHO 2021a). Zambia’s Ministry of Health reported a 10% discard rate in 2021. Discards were 3% attributable to HIV, 5.4% to HBV, 0.9% to HCV, and 0.6% to Syphilis (Zambia MoH 2022). 
The need (how much blood is needed, who typically needs it, and for what uses?)
In sub-Saharan Africa, the utilization of blood transfusions follows a pattern, with a significant portion of the blood supply directed towards younger female populations. About 65% of blood transfusions are administered to children under the age of five in low-income countries. In contrast, 76% of transfusions in high-income countries are given to individuals over 65 (“WHO Blood Safety” 2024). Some reasons for this difference are the prevalence of severe anemia in children and pregnancy complications in sub-Saharan Africa (Doughty 2022; Shinsugi and Mumbi Heebenzu 2023). Hemorrhage during pregnancy accounts for about 25% of maternal deaths each year, and 99% of these take place in low-income countries (WHO 2010). In sub-Saharan Africa, transfusions are often reserved for urgent situations (Barro et al. 2018). This urgency is reflected in ZNBTS’s administrative data on blood utilization that reveals 75% of blood requests in Lusaka province are classified as either “Emergency” or “Urgent”. 
National Blood Policies
WHO recommendations
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries centralize blood donation testing and processing through a national blood service. Centralization of activities allows for advantages in efficacy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness (WHO 2021b). This, in turn, can enhance the efficiency of blood services and can reduce costs. By streamlining and centralizing processes, national blood services can achieve a higher, more consistent quality standard in the blood supply. According to the WHO’s Global Status Report on Blood Safety and Availability (2021), about 90% of African countries have a blood service unit based in their Ministry of Health and a national blood policy in 2018. Historically, these countries have the most volunteer nonremunerated blood donors on the continent. 
Zambia Blood Policy
Zambia follows the WHO’s recommendations and houses its blood services within the Zambia National Blood Transfusion Service (ZNBTS), an institution under the Ministry of Health. ZNBTS is centrally coordinated in Lusaka but decentralized to render services to hospitals nationwide. This structure is designed to ensure that whole blood and blood products are accessible across all health facilities, aiming to meet the needs of patients efficiently. Despite this, the system faces challenges that impact its effectiveness. 
According to Zambia’s Ministry of Health strategic plan (2022), challenges to consistent blood supply include disruptions in the supply chain for blood safety commodities, a shortage of operational vehicles (although this issue was recently addressed by World Bank funding), and the absence of a call center to support donor recruitment, recall, and retention efforts. Additionally, the capacity for blood component production is limited, and there is a lack of a comprehensive, coordinated legal framework governing blood transfusion services and related procedures. 
ZNBTS has set objectives for the period between 2022 and 2026 to respond to these challenges. Their strategy aims to increase annual blood collection to 360,000 units. The plan includes measures to enhance the accessibility of safe blood products in all health facilities, strengthen the institutional and regulatory framework, and reduce the blood discard rate from 10% in 2021 to 1% by 2026 (Zambia MoH 2022). 
Blood Supply
Typical Characteristics of Blood Donors In sub-Saharan Africa
The profile of blood donors in sub-Saharan Africa holds a handful of typical characteristics. The demographic of blood donors is typically male, with a higher level of education (Allain 2019; Owusu-Ofori et al. 2010; Urgesa, Hassen, and Seyoum 2017). The influence of education could be multifaceted, but a correlation between education and knowledge about blood donation has been identified (Allain 2019). In a study of 845 individuals in Harar, Ethiopia, the intention to give blood among illiterate study participants was about half of that of educated individuals (Urgesa, Hassen, and Seyoum 2017). A significant segment of the volunteer blood donor population in the region includes school-age children, typically beginning at age 16, representing a vital component of the voluntary blood donation system. According to the WHO status report on blood availability and safety, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Zambia, and Eswatini collected more than 40% of their blood supply from individuals under 18 years old in 2018 (WHO 2021a). Zambia’s blood donor inventory indicates that about 23% of donations have come from school sites since November 2018, though the completeness of this data is inconsistent across provinces. A school environment is conducive to blood donation as peer pressure increases, and students can witness influencers such as teachers and principals donate (Owusu-Ofori et al. 2010; Allain 2019). 
The motivations driving individuals to donate blood in sub-Saharan Africa are varied, but there is generally a high willingness to donate and positive perceptions of blood donation (Allain 2019; Pule et al. 2014; Urgesa, Hassen, and Seyoum 2017). Willingness is particularly high when an individual’s family has received blood in the past or when someone has interacted with someone who has donated blood before (Mohammed and Essel 2018; Pule et al. 2014). Studies that deploy a prosocial motivation measurement find a link between altruism and the intention to donate blood (Mauka et al. 2015; Stutzer, Goette, and Zehnder 2011; Goette, Stutzer, and Frey, n.d.), though this depth of research into prosocial motivation is uncommon in the sub-Saharan context. Lastly, the initial experience of a blood donor indicates whether or not s/he will be a repeat donor. A positive first-time experience is correlated with repeat donation (Allain et al. 2008; Mauka et al. 2015).
Typical Characteristics of Blood Donors in Zambia

Challenges and Barriers to Blood Donation
The challenges and barriers individuals cite as preventing them from donating blood are consistent around sub-Saharan Africa. Potential donors face obstacles such as not knowing where to donate blood and lacking nearby blood centres (Mauka et al. 2015; Beyene 2020; Elzahaf et al. 2023). This logistical barrier is compounded by the fact that repeat donors are typically not actively solicited to donate, which diminishes the likelihood of them taking the initiative to donate blood (Pule et al. 2014; Urgesa, Hassen, and Seyoum 2017; Mohammed and Essel 2018).
Another barrier to blood donation is rooted in specific personal fears. These include fear of pain, needles, the possibility of fainting, and concerns about the body’s ability to regenerate the blood lost during the donation process (Allain 2019; Koster and Hassall 2011; Osaro and Charles 2011; Alinon et al. 2014). Additionally, concerns about mandatory screening for diseases such as HIV, which has been noted in studies conducted in Cameroon, Tanzania, and South Africa, are a deterrent for some considering blood donation. In Cameroon, it is a widely held belief that the psychological effect of knowing your HIV-positive status would shorten your life (Koster and Hassall 2011). 
Across sub-Saharan Africa, the substantial majority of blood donors are male. Potential female blood donors experience the usual set of challenges and barriers previously listed, as well as specific challenges regarding their sex.  Women who are pregnant and breastfeeding are often not eligible to donate blood. WHO guidelines state that women shouldn't donate blood nine months after giving birth and until three months after the baby gets most of their nutrients from solid food. There is a gap in the literature regarding gender differences in blood donation in sub-Saharan Africa. Ineligibility while pregnant does not fully explain the significant differences in donor turnout between men and women. Further, blood donation in high-income countries, such as the United States, shows almost an even distribution of donations between male and female blood donors (ABC and ADRP 2022).
Successful Interventions to Improve Blood Supply
Many of these challenges can be mitigated with proactive mobile clinics and blood donation and transfusion education. Ghana is often mentioned in the literature for its innovation in blood donation initiatives (Allain et al. 2008; Osaro and Charles 2011). The country's national blood service employs various strategies to increase blood donations. These strategies include developing media partnerships with local radio stations to advertise and host blood drives, creating awards and recognition programs for schools that excel in blood drive participation, establishing youth blood donor clubs, and leveraging the influence of high-profile influencers such as political figures or religious leaders who publicly donate blood (Owusu-Ofori et al. 2010; Allain et al. 2008). 
Hosting public blood drives at radio stations and places of worship was an effective way of engaging segments of Ghana’s population to donate. Religious congregations are emerging as a promising avenue for increasing blood donations, mainly when congregation leaders actively participate and encourage their members to donate (Owusu-Ofori et al. 2010). Hosting blood drives at popular radio stations has successfully drawn in donors and facilitated repeat blood donations. These events are advertised at no cost to the Ghanaian blood service and then made into engaging community events with music, storytelling, and education on blood transfusion. The radio station drives were scheduled three times a year, and 72% of the donors who participated were repeat donors (Owusu-Ofori et al. 2010; Osaro and Charles 2011). Drives at both places of worship and radio stations were scheduled to take place during school recess when student blood drives were less effective.
The literature puts forward several recommendations to increase walk-in donations at blood centers. These include educational programs to alleviate fears related to the donation process and dispel myths, particularly around pain and blood regeneration (Barro et al. 2018; Koster and Hassall 2011). Including education on the importance of blood donation or exposing potential donors to the life stories of people who have received blood in the past might also increase the intention to donate and create a culture of volunteerism (Pule et al. 2014; Mauka et al. 2015). In regions with high HIV prevalence, integrating HIV awareness education can help mitigate concerns about the screening process (Koster and Hassall 2011). 
Improving donor awareness on where and how frequently they can donate blood will help close the gap between the percentage of populations that report they are willing to donate and the amount of actual donations collected (Mauka et al. 2015; Alinon et al. 2014). Advertising campaigns can be done via media outlets, as studies in Botswana, Ethiopia, and Ghana show most donors first hear about blood donation campaigns this way (Pule et al. 2014; Urgesa, Hassen, and Seyoum 2017; Mohammed and Essel 2018). Personalized SMS messages to remind repeat donors that they are eligible to donate again might also be an effective strategy to increase repeat walk-in donations (Allain 2019). While empirical research evaluating the effectiveness of these strategies is limited, anecdotal evidence and an understanding of challenges and barriers to blood donation suggest they are promising avenues to increase blood supply.
Recommendations
Recommendations for ZNBTS 
We recommend that ZNBTS address the barriers to donation listed in this literature review. Work to reduce common fears and misconceptions through public education campaigns done through radio or other media outlets. Messages could include information about blood transfusion's safety and health benefits, the minimal risks involved, and the critical need for donations. Media campaigns are a chance to leverage new relationships with influencers to encourage them to be solid voices and combat common fears and misconceptions in their communities. Additionally, improving the convenience of donating blood by increasing the number of donation centres and mobile units, if possible, and ensuring that these drives are well-advertised and easily accessible.
Continue to target youth and educational institutions. Given the significant contribution of school-age donors in sub-Saharan Africa and, more specifically, Zambia, ZNBTS should strengthen partnerships with schools and universities. This could involve organizing more regular donation events on campuses and incorporating blood donation education into the curriculum to build a culture of donation among students. Male donors should continue to be targeted as they have been a reliable donor base in the past, but female-specific educational material will help encourage more females to donate. 
Implementing a structured donor retention program might increase repeat donations. ZNBTS should develop a donor management strategy that includes regular communication with previous donors through personalized SMS messages or phone calls. Recognizing and appreciating donors will encourage them to keep donating. This could be through acknowledgment in community events, certificates of donation, or small incentives like stickers or t-shirts.

We started by reflecting on our recent connection with the Gates team and how positive it was to get their feedback confirming the value they see in this work. We had a thoughtful discussion about tailoring the compendium for practical implementation by organizations in this field, while also considering the different disciplinary approaches.




Melinda walked through the draft compendium structure she created with input from Rachel and myself. We discussed sections like the overview and purpose, methods, and conceptualizing women in leadership. I suggested incorporating determinants from our formative research and scoping reports. Rachel helped us think through how to present indicators and the results framework for easy navigation.




We talked at length about measuring the SDG 5.5 targets on women's political participation and how interventions could contribute to progress on those goals. Melinda outlined the timeline and budget, and we agreed to flag potential delays if Gates is late providing feedback. I suggested communicating our expected response timeframe clearly.




By the end of our meeting, we had assigned action items and reached consensus on finalizing the structure with Valentina's input. I'm looking forward to incorporating any feedback and sending the draft to Rachel and Gates next week. Overall it was a very productive discussion that will help strengthen our compendium.""",PROJECTS

And we can just all be, you know, sickness free for a little bit. Yeah, yeah. Okay, we can jump right into today's meeting. Thank you for joining. For today's meeting, I first thought we could start out with like some reflections on the connection. And then I had a moment to speak on this yesterday. But it would be good to just have that as a full team, and then jump into the Compendium structure. So a walkthrough of the current draft and thoughts about how the structure should take form that me and Melinda have put forth. And just to just share ideas with you, Rachel, and then just have a discussion off of that. And then we can just also speak to like timelines, budget and staffing, if there's any need for adjustments around those, and then end off with any other business. Does that sound good to everyone? Good. So I'm starting off with reflections on the connection. Melinda and I had a little bit of a touch point on this yesterday, and we were feeling good about the connection we had with the gates team. You know, we felt that the the Compendium is useful to them. And this is not just like a throwaway product that, you know, they are placating us with? And yeah, we still have I guess questions around who the Compendium is for as this will heavily. This will heavily influence the structure of the Compendium so I you know, I'm guessing we can have a conversation around that as well. Is this something that we'll lean heavily on the foundation to dictate? Or do we just proposed direction and just have them agree or not agree? So yeah, Belinda, Rachel, any reflections, anything that you'd like to pick up on?
I feel you, like capture what we discussed. So who wishes to share her?
Yeah, no, I appreciate those reflections. And I think I Yeah, share the same, like, it was really encouraging just to hear like that they were happy, you know, confirming that they were happy with what we've made so far. And that they really see this as being a valuable product. Yeah, maybe it's too bad. It's too bad. Iris wasn't there to be able to speak potentially at that higher level, like for some of those questions about like, yeah, what does this mean for the rest of the engagement and the budget and things like that, although I don't think we have a particular reason to worry. It's just that they, you know, I think, as Sarah said, like, they just can't really like speak on behalf of the Foundation. I think you raise a really good point about the audience. I hadn't really thought about that, although I know that it did sort of come up a couple of times where they would say, Yeah, we know that academics would sort of like have this type of standard. But then it sounded like the goal for this Compendium was much more implementer focused. So yeah, that I don't remember exactly when that came out. But they said, envision this as something that like people, like an implementer could pick up and like implement in their workplace or like us to create indicators. So I think Sara said something about, like, let's sort of make it practical, or that's kind of like how I interpreted what she was saying as much as possible. Rather than like focusing to super theoretical, because, like, or I think she used the example of like, a lot of organizations aren't going to be able to measure change in norms over time, but you can chain or you can measure, you know, some more practical kinds of outputs, and maybe that gives you an indication. So yeah, curious whether that is helpful at all. Whether you guys had sort of the same impression about the audience. Yeah, was there
like I didn't want to answer that. She said pass.
Yes. That is super helpful. I do recall, Rachel mentioning that I have now Rachel, Sarah, Sarah been getting names curfews and As Sarah mentioning that, I think her words were to tailor the structure for designing the for those people who are designing women leadership programs are interested in measuring the evolution. So I had highlighted that in the notes. And I do agree, I think that just the additional, like, indication that it is it still might appeal to a broader audience. And that we keep that in mind is where I've wanted the most clarity, because we are talking about all psychologists and activists and economists. But I do think that it is practical for us to first target sort of people in the industry and who have, you know, who have we we've been building references and information off of and in line with, with that, that, that that work?
Right, yeah. Yeah, here you go. Because I think when when we think about like those different sector approaches, it's almost more like, which methods are we going to use? And I think and Valentina, like, sort of tried to raise that, you know, to say, like, yeah, in different disciplines, people, like will approach this very differently. So it sounded like what they said was, you know, we should keep that in mind, but just really outlined clearly, in that one page overview of like, what methods we used to say, we took this approach, and we recognize, like, maybe that's not the norm in psychology or whatever. But I think we're gonna end up taking more of an economics approach just because Valentina is an economist. So I would assume that's kind of where we lean, but yeah. Hey, welcome back. Melinda. Sorry, we lost you there. Sorry, dealing with that. Cool, cool. Yeah, but but I think on this question of, sort of audience and where we tailor it, like, I think it's cool. And I we're just sort of in agreement that it's like the ultimate audiences, people who are designing and implementing women in leadership programs. But then, yeah, that as I was just saying, we're, like, discussing kind of which methodological approach we use, and whether we can cover kind of all of the different disciplines there, or if we just need to be explicit about kind of which approach we're taking. So yeah, that's, that's what we
said this route is for us to just upfront say, which paths among the many who have chosen to go down? And why and just stick with that, because we do not manage to touch on every point. Yeah, and I agree that we might go the route of the losing an economist lens, because it sits very well with the things that we do. And always he has expertise. So agreed.
Yeah. All right. Yes, and then we wanted to get into the Compendium structure, just a walkthrough of what the current draft looks like and the thoughts around that and then perhaps just a discussion on that. So based on the conversation we've just had where we have an economists lens if you just give me a second now that you mind if I share the draft as is and just walk through it
no I don't.
Is my screen visible to everyone
sounds fancy Oh, it cleared up.
Okay, so I just wanted to walk through the draft as we are seeing it to shape up and just to have like a an overview discussion so we know where to make adjustments and just any like inputs that you have as we refine this before your your actual review Rachel So we have a acknowledgments table of contents. So the usual like, preface to the, the, the main body of the Compendium. And sorry, just frozen. Okay. Okay, so we have the acknowledgments Table of Contents of Ford, that will come from Frida, and an executive summary. And then to get into kind of, you know, the breakdown of the Compendium, we have an overview and purpose. And for this section, we want to speak to, you know, the rationale behind the Compendium, the will initiatives and how this Compendium came about and what the objectives of the Compendium are. And please feel free to stop me at any point, Rachel. And so we have why we have why this Compendium broken down into the purpose on the scope. The method section, which was highlighted in the connection is very important. And in terms of, you know, what, what steps we've taken to get to this point, what references who have we consulted, what our process has been, and just a glossary of terms. And this is just the terms that used throughout the Compendium, which we put here, because it's also very important to just unify on definitions and terms at the start of the Compendium. So just we have that common understanding amongst users. And the next part of the overview, and the purpose is like conceptualizing women in leadership. And with this section, we thought to highlight just a higher level of our theory of change. So not in depth or in detail, but how our theory of change feeds into the strategy of the foundation, which ladders up to SDG 5.5. So the conceptualizing women and leadership will have like an explanatory paragraph or two, and then we'll have like a visual representation of that as well. I have put together like a draft of visual, currently, just so in this draft visual, we have embedded our theory of change with the goals of the strategy goals of bmgf, as well as the SDG goal. So we have the barriers against the intervention. So interventions were grouped together and kind of just grouped together in like more concise way. So it's not too bulky, and just tried to capture all of the sub like the bigger categories of interventions with the outcomes and outcomes laddered against, you know, the the pillars. I'm not sure. And I think this is a point of clarity for the organization if we still are, you know, holding to the pillars that they initially like introduced and that are also present in their frameworks. But I have included those pillars there. And then how those latter up
thanks, secretly, I think, I think Melinda has a hand up. Oh, wanted to jump in.
Okay. Yes, Malanga?
Okay, thanks. I was given a time to finish. Because I wanted to ask like a couple of things and clarify a couple of things about this visual. I had suggested that we added, because like, it's kind of unclear where our line of thinking is coming from. And what I'm not too sure is, if we should call it a theory of change the idea inside the theory of change, or just quiet, like we'll conceptual framework that we want to put together based on the information that we have formative research and pieces like that.
Yeah, I mean, I think that will be interesting to get their feedback on as well. I like
what is being done and how it is covering the different determinants that have been highlighted in literature. So it's just an additional piece which can go into the appendix. I think
Yeah, no, I think this is really cool. I mean, they did say that they wanted at the near the beginning to have that list of determinants, or like at least the ones that were considering. So I think what we can do is at least those determinants that came out of it in in the body of the Compendium. And then yeah, if we think that maybe the table would be better in the appendix, and then that's fine. But let's at least make sure we mentioned which ones we are considering. But then also, I think they said to acknowledge that, like, we recognize these aren't all of the determinants, these are just like, the ones that came out strongly in the formative research. Yeah.
And I think we could borrow from the scoping reports on what, what goes here and the barriers that we had reported here, okay.
Okay, that's well noted. Just to continue, we have structure and content, what is covered, and this will be also visually aided, and this can speak to, you know, what we have just talked about in there is a whole list of determinants. And we can say, Okay, this is where we're focusing on, and this is where our Compendium indicators are, you know, coming from. So we'll just highlight that. And who should use the Compendium just highlight the primary audience, I think this 5050,
we would put there so that people already know like, some of the places where this indicator is being used, one thing that I see that you do not add sequela is that point where we said, we would want to? So Rachel, this walk will be comprehensive, and will speak to that particular intervention in totality. So we were we, we thought that instead, we have this approach, where we slice it up into the different interventions that we're going to focus on, or key barriers or whatever team that we decide to use. But I think it will be easier to use, if we have this implementer, who is working in a leadership program and maybe wants to do their framework and come to this section, and find what we have there. So that's just a little note on the usability as we were thinking about it. The other thing is, I caught Sarah talking about output indicators to say, if it's someone who's just starting this program, they might be interested in the outputs, rather than the outcomes. And from the process that we had there, where we have like different types of indicators, we can have output indicators, outcome indicators and impact indicators. So I did think that if that is possible for us to put those different categories of, of indicators in this table, so add an additional column and then output indicators, we add those then outcome, we add those in there and impact we add those. Yeah, that was the additional thoughts that I had. And I will be able to hear what Valentina will say. But if we use that approach of having like segmenting the different types of indicators, it means the initial focus was on outcome indicators on. So I think that's a conversation that we can have, and with Valentina and with gates and see where we land
Yeah, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Um, just one, like more high level conceptual question. I really liked this idea of like putting the these tables in the text, and then people can just navigate to like, the section that's relevant to that a minute. It also like, looks nicer. I'm wondering, like, so the the beautiful results framework that we had put together? Where, how does this, how does this overlap with that or like, is it worth presenting sort of its overall results framework and then and then breaking it down further into these tables? Or I don't know, maybe I maybe I'm just not like understanding how this all connects.
So if you look at the results framework, it has leadership interventions with an explanation of what those are right? So we have captured this when we talk about upfront describing what leadership intervention is. So this text goes up front. And then when we have these metrics, I hope we're on the same document. Yeah. Yes. Then when we have the enhanced Julian's in US leadership skills, these then go to column, column. Measurements and column indicator. Yes. So it's like, and rate goes there. Yeah.
Okay. Okay. Yeah, no, that's great. So I mean, is it? Is that kind of what this like, currently, what we're calling the IDX. And site Well, theory of change, well, that present, basically, these broader categories. And then each section will then break that down and present the individual indicators. Because I think like, yeah, just want to make sure people kind of see in one place. The, like a graphic that that just shows these categories, leadership development programs, coaching and mentoring, networking, collaboration, and how they fit into the different. I mean, what we're calling pillars, but like, even if we don't call them pillars, it's just like different levels of working.
Inside or outside. I'm able to navigate back to that. To this, yeah. Okay. Yes. So this one, again, it captures the interventions are there, right? And come to the outcomes, which will be a little bit expanded there. So then what we are seeing in this framework, enhanced self awareness and self efficacy, those are going to be there in this column of outcomes.
Okay, cool. Yeah. As long as we kind of present the whole the big picture and then start narrowing in then that that looks great. Yeah.
So I think, borrowing from Sorry,
sorry, go ahead.
I was saying like, borrowing from volunteers thinking I don't, I don't think we want to send people to different things, like, like, links to like this document, and then links to there and whatnot. If we can condense everything and make it usable that when they look at one, and in this case, they start by looking at the conceptual framework and understand how things flow. And then then we get into the different indicators for each intervention. I think that makes more smoother flow of things, rather than having three different things and making reference in drawing from those. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, no, totally. This is great. I was just gonna ask, and maybe this is where we're going next. But I know they mentioned the sub indicators of SDG 5.5. Have we started looking at those yet?
Yes, we have. So the sub indicators, so SDG 5.51, is a portion of six to the portion of women in parliament and SDG 5.52 is in managerial positions. So both of those indicators have been captured in our indicator framework. So it's just a matter of speaking. And, you know, just speaking to how those indicators ladder up to these grander indicators of measuring these SDG SDGs. And this is what the next section is. So we'll have the target, which is the
case. So in the SDGs, there are two indicators that the SDGs tracking for SDG 5.5. Right. The charges, okay. Okay, okay. Yes. Okay. Yes. So
yeah, just explain how the interventions either like you do the leadership programs can increase capacity for women to run and when elected office or like advocacy in, you know, different intervention contexts. So just what the interventions how the interventions speak to a on these greater use graded targets. So that's the like the final section of the Compendium. And yeah, just measuring contributions ologies. So like an indicator, I'm not alignment, as well as data integral integration. So we show which particular indicators and how data is collected from those interventions and can be used to inform statistics or progress reports on the SDGs.
Awesome, yes. That sounds great. Cool. Yeah. No, I think this is super exciting. I need to get volunteers I on it. And then the planet, send it to gates by Monday, right.
Yeah. Checking in with Valentina tomorrow. And then once Valentina checks in sequela, can you feedback will come, and then sequelae, if you can have it. And this is going into the timeline discussion, if you can have it back to Rachel on Monday, Monday morning, so that Rachel can look. And then if there's any feedback by end of day, you should have done that. And then we send it out at the end of day, okay. And the end of day, I mean, like 4pm, so that we send it out, they find it as their base.
And with regards to just timelines, budgets, staffing, do we have any, like, addition to the six, the seven to eight weeks, I had spoken to Melinda, about just looking through references, but as the structure has come together, just adding like a, just a lot in two weeks for that earring,
like, are we already now in week one, or does week one start? Next week. Um,
I would say week one starts from next week, because we will still be primarily looking at the structure and waiting for feedback from the Gates team. But we will also be looking at reference refinement in the background. So I guess those two activities can now overlap and just the reference
work should be going on. So that's how I was thinking about this. And yeah, my point about the timelines was to say if after the discussion, we feel that there is need to adjust that. I believe, like, we had a good point to say that this time might not work, or it's going to work, because now we have had their feedback. And that thought we've had to give thought to the process. And then we can speak back to them. But I think the seven weeks is more than enough for us to get done with this week.
Thank you for the clarity on that one. Yeah,
yeah, I agree with you. Yeah. Now seeing the that in the concept we had said as our first week one was the creating the structure. So yeah, I think that makes sense that, that that's what we just did. Yeah, I also think seven weeks should be fine. I mean, the one thing is, if they don't give us feedback in a timely manner. So I don't know how to, I wonder if we just want to flag that. Like, I know that they said that they are going to try and be very responsive. But yeah, maybe we should just say, you know, as discussed, like we think seven weeks with, with the budget that we shared, the concept note will work with the caveat that we will cram the Gates Foundation or whatever we think is reasonable. Otherwise, it may delay our timelines. What do you think?
Okay, so my thought was when we send it out, we communicate our expectation for when we when it would be great for us to get feedback from them. And then yeah, then mention that to say like, this will help us stay with regret if you give us feedback in this period of time to still within the cameras. Otherwise, yeah, we might spend time.
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, no, that sounds good to sort of outline
Okay thank you both with that we've come to the end of our meeting unless anybody has it.""",PROJECTS

to Nakubyana, me, Haidee, Beenish

Dear, Dilshad and Nakybyana,

 

I hope you are well and had a restful weekend. Firstly, I thought I would introduce myself, I’m Gemma, and I have recently joined the Community Engagement Team at Wellcome and wanted to introduce myself as the point of contact for this relationship and piece of work. I’m looking forward to meeting you on Thursday afternoon where I hope we can collectively refine the direction and objectives of the Dignity project. 

 

In advance of our meeting on Thursday I thought I would send the following agenda. It would be great to use this time to iron out some details for the project, for example, timelines and discuss some initial reflections we had on the concept note you shared with Beenish and Haidee before me joining. 

 

Introductions  –

It would be great to hear about the team and any projects undertaken by the team on ‘Dignity in Health ‘.
	

 14:00-14:05 

Aligning the focus of the workshop to understand how incorporating a dignity lens to Wellcome’s priority areas and key geographies can contribute to a healthier future for everyone. 

 
	

14:05– 14:30 

Dignity audit. 

 
	

14:20- 14:30 

Understanding the workshop’s format e.g. A conference-style event or training and development workshop. Potential for a lunchtime talk the next day. 

Clarifying timelines 
	

14:30 – 14:40 

Steps forward. 
	

14:40- 14:45 

 

The concept note for the proposed work with Wellcome was great, we particularly appreciated that the concept note demonstrated some tangible examples of how dignity can be centred in Global Health, for example in clinical trials.  With a shift towards health equity at Wellcome more broadly, it would be good to refine the workshop agenda to ensure it strongly aligns with the current activities and priorities at Wellcome within and beyond Community Engagement. 

 

Secondly, the second section on ‘how to think about dignity and why dignity matters’ will be valuable for Wellcome colleagues. I wonder if we can use this space to deliberate and share evidence on how a dignity lens could contribute to achieving Wellcome’s mission to ‘use science to create a healthier future for everyone’.  

Thirdly, in section three, which will share research on dignity experiences in the 6-7 geographies in which the Africa Asia Programmes (AAPS) sit in. It would be good to discuss if it is possible to cover each of these, in addition to Wellcome’s Research Programme’s Health Challenge Area Priorities in Discovery Research, Mental Health, Infectious Disease, and Climate Health. Could these be discussed separately or perhaps amalgamated? 

 

Finally, the dignity audit you propose to conduct sounds very interesting, and we are looking forward to understanding this in more detail. It would be good to clarify if this should be focused on some key areas of practice or if it should be more general and perhaps linked to health equity. I would also need to understand how I could support you in facilitating these consultations with colleagues at Wellcome, what format this would take, how much time it would require, and where it gets shared. 

 

I hope this sounds okay for you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.

 

Looking forwards to speaking further on Thursday.

 

Many thanks and best wishes,

Gemma

I have a proposal centred around using some of the time during the AHMs for 'learning labs'.

. I think these are both great ideas - incorporating into AHMs and having Lunch and Learns. Just a couple thoughts below:
From my understanding, the idea of having case studies / cross learnings would be similar to having project spotlights in the AHMs, correct? If so, I feel like that could work. A concern I have is that people could potentially complain about this being ""extra work"" that they don't have time for given everyone's busy project schedules. could you please share the link to the session plan doc in here so we can use it to think through how we can operationalize incorporating some of the ideas MM has shared into AHMs?",PROJECTS

VB: Thought the requests is, number one, the spreadsheet that we've been working on, you know, with some additions, and number two, a very brief document, which describes what the spreadsheet is and isnt. 
MM: package in a very user friendly way, rather than just having a spreadsheet. What speak about what the background is incorporated visual that sent some of that formative research, answer the question of why we have this Compendium, the purpose, the methodology, and then go into the actual pieces
SS: Creating a structure that will potentially be circutlated and all these pieces are necessary. 
VB: Understands the intention. nd what are the sources of indicators, and maybe like a brief documents of what that spreadsheet is about.








Conceptual Framework:
VB: 1) Is contextual framework is something that BMBF has already seen. 2) When interventions and outcomes here, are we sure that they're comprehensive.
MM: Outcomes are not complete. As outcomes tethered to Output, Intermediate, and Final.  the outcomes that we're going to focus on are either the intermediate outcomes, final outcomes or outputs, because there was that talk during that own outputs as well. So we need to make a call about how comprehensive and what we're going to focus on this particular section.
VB: Knowledge enhancement wording not clear. (*refine to research outputs.)




Barriers:
VB: Is this the comprehensive list o Barriers: SS: No. strategic exercise where we listed the universe of barriers. May need to circle  back and ask for input. MM: reporting the barriers that have come from the research that they have commissioned and shared with us. this is the barriers we are the mappings to interventions so that we can kind of show a picture of where the gaps are.
VB: 
MM: Add guiding text as we are putting this particular slide together to say, for this particular table, who would want to prioritize, or two would want to focus on the barriers that at this stage of your strategy you are focused on? And I think back on that, would that be helpful?
VB: these are the barriers we're focused on. Is the is this Okay, number one, is this graphic helpful? Number two.




Indicators: 
VB: Consistent phrasing across the spreadsheet.
VB: And I would maybe link to the theory of change, and just say, you know, the indicators, the matrix of indicators focuses on intermediate outcomes, final outcomes and impacts and refer to the theory of change, here's the link to find what they are. And maybe just make it visually clear in this theory of change the differences between the intermediate and final outcomes and impacts
MM: Agreed. Mention in a sentence or two which indicatos and at what level we are focusing on.




Theory of Chnage: 
VB: Is ToC organized by Intevrntion? 
MM: Just to improve the usability of this particular resource. So from the discussion with Sarah, they are looking to work, according to program, and if they do grants, they might grant according to program. 
VB: Whatever way, which is, let's also make sure that the TOC is structured in that way too. So that it's consistent.
MM: We have had many iteration of the ToC that evolved across making the ToC usable. 
VB: Infer consistency across documents across terminology across colors in different documents
MM: Barriers in ToC, it's then remains consistent with this conceptual, quote unquote, conceptual framework that we've put in, and for the sake of organization and presenting the indicators, I believe, we could put guidance that, then we are focusing on interventions, because those are the things that the grant and they put their money on, they put money on interventions, and that is why then we go ahead and organize the indicators based on the interventions.
MM: Make sure it's organized by interventions, every single thing.
VB: Let's seek minimal input from them. The way that I would approach this is, here's what we're doing very tiered. We're going to organize this by the intervention, because we think this makes the most sense. Here are all the interventions, and here's how it links to different documents. If there's a problem with it, fine, they can bring it up. But I think we should come with clarity and the plan because we're gonna get confused in these iterations. 




Interventions: 
VB: for the outline purposes make sure to list all programs. And, you know, it's fine to have placeholders but at least you will list every single thing that will be covered without the detail.
VB: No need to list the same thing for every single one. I would say mentorship program, given example, what are they needed there some name? Male ally, she programs, what is an example? What is something and then just lists to link to the Excel sheet? Which you can clearly and again, it has the same exact words, right?
SS: Because the interventions are condenscend tin the consptual framework, lost examoples of what kind of interventions can be had under these buckets.
VB: So mentorship program, there's a column that says type of programs, and you could select mentorship program, and you're going to see all the list of indicators. And no need to insert another table in here because the table is the Excel table.




Indicator Matrix: 
VB: Columns are already established in the other spreadsheet. Drop who has used this, and mode of collection in columns.
VB: But as long as there's no repetition, and it's like, interfere the types of programs. And if you want to look at details of how to measure stuff for incentive program, go to this Excel spreadsheet.
SS: Final section is ladderign up to sdg 5.5. VB: Not 




Intergation of Outputs:
VB: I think what we clearly want to communicate in this is how different outputs that we've put together, are going to be tied in this document.
MM: I have a bit of like clarification. So my understanding is that we did not want to have or we were moving away from having three standalone documents. Thought the goal was to consolidate all the information into one document, eliminatinf the need for seperate spreadsheets and theory of change documents
VB: I agree, I would cut on the number of outputs, for sure. I think the two main ones for me, is some sort of theory of change. And the reason I'm saying linked to the theory of change is because it's just really hard to insert it in the document because the text is too small. That's all it's just practical reasons. And the second thing is the spreadsheet. So those are the two and then the the results framework, the outcomes and metrics that should be a part of one of the other documents.
MM: The other thing that I wanted and I see where all the time I wanted to ask is then I don't know I'm thinking about and maybe it's because I'm anchored on how I've seen other companions presented. And all the information is in there without having link out to other pieces of information. And I think that was where my mind was when I was thinking of then taking apart the spreadsheet and fitting it in there. So I guess that's that. Yeah, you have to make a call on that. 
VB: I see where you're coming from, I think it's just the practical considerations because the table has too many columns, too many rows. And an advantage of having intimate spreadsheets is because you can filter by stuff.""",PROJECTS

Tom Wein and Cait Lamberton

Psychologist Joseph Henrich wrote that the bulk of social science research remains focused on the experiences and opinions of people in Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic countries. As authors from the UK and US respectively, we recognize how research tends to be centered in and around our countries of origin. We believe it is urgent to understand the similarities and differences of people's experiences across the globe through a more equitable distribution of research. At IDinsight we aim to correct this imbalance in access to locally relevant evidence.
This is particularly salient in our study of dignity. Given that respect for people’s dignity requires that they are seen and heard, there is a particular urgency in examining popular understandings of dignity across different cultures and situations. We have previously researched and published how people in the United States define dignity. But it is problematic to extrapolate that other people everywhere share this definition or perspective on dignity. Practitioners need to make a concerted effort to understand what dignity means to a population being targeted for a policy or program so that they are able to measure if it's being upheld. What do voices from the global majority outside the West say about what dignity means to them?
Our data shows that dignity matters in the US, Nigeria and India, but people have differing understandings of dignity. With a deeper understanding of people's definition of dignity in a particular context, we can design better, more relevant policies and programs to affirm that dignity. 
Study design
To gain some preliminary insights into the way that the US-centric conceptualization of dignity might differ from those in the Global South, we collected 1435 survey responses: 508 from India, 541 from Nigeria, and 386 from the United States. This was done through Qualtrics’ online panels in these countries, with data collection taking place in March 2023. 
As part of this study, we randomly assigned people to versions of the survey that varied in their emphasis on agency, equity, and representation, in order to allow for variance in the perception of whether the researchers were treating them with respect. We then asked people to help us understand what concepts and words they associate with dignity. Finally, we asked them about their willingness to answer a voluntary set of questions to help researchers better understand their experiences and to participate in a standing research panel in the future – if they felt they had been treated respectfully, we anticipated they would be more willing to do both. 
This comparative study builds on a previous study in which we employed the same design in a US-only sample. We report the results of that study in Wein, Ghai, Lamberton & Saldanha, 2023.
The consequences of respect
Across all three countries, the extent to which people felt they would be treated by researchers with respect predicted their interest in participating further. When people feel treated with respect for their dignity, it matters to them, and they are willing to reciprocate - in this case by volunteering their valuable time to researchers. 
Specifically, we conducted a logistic regression on whether people’s sense of respectedness predicted whether they would altruistically opt-in to help researchers by answering extra, unrequired questions. This showed that peoples’ sense that their dignity was affirmed by researchers had a huge influence (Wald chi-square = 42.14, p < .0001). This effect didn’t vary based on peoples’ country of origin: treating people with dignity always increased their willingness to help. 
We further examined how much extra time people were willing to give. This willingness to help was reflected in substantial increases in the time that participants shared with us. As shown in the figure, the effect was greatest among participants from Nigeria, who nearly doubled their engagement time in the survey.
This contributes to mounting evidence of the positive outcomes for individuals, programs, and societies when people are treated with respect. It echoes a similar finding in the US in the earlier study, where people were significantly more likely to volunteer to take part in a panel if they felt they had been treated in a way that respects their dignity by researchers. We should care about dignity for its own sake, but it is helpful to note that it leads to other positive results as well.
Associations of dignity

We observed that participants in these three countries reported different associations between dignity and other concepts. Constructs like dignity are never precisely defined in their daily usage. We can better understand the nuances of what people mean by dignity by looking at the other ideas people link it to. 
For the US, dignity was associated with ideas of freedom, equity, and choice. Meanwhile, compared to the other places, the US shows a lower association between dignity and power. It is also less associated with contentment, loyalty, trust, and hope than in either Nigeria or India. It appears to also be less socially resonant: whereas when a person’s dignity is denied respondents in both Nigeria and India associate it with the disruption of interpersonal harmony, undermined social status, and religious differences, it was so to a significantly weaker degree in the US.
Indian and Nigerian respondents also showed different associations with dignity. Nigerian respondents showed the tightest connection between dignity and contentment and a weaker connection to power and anger than Indian respondents. Indian respondents, meanwhile, showed the strongest association between power, anger, and dignity. 
In Nigeria, dignity bridged the community and the individual more than in both other markets: denying dignity is more associated with the denial of voice to a group or community, the violation of community norms, the ability to express one’s preferences, and respect for individual self-expression than it is in the US or India.
Dignity is never a standalone concept. Everywhere it has a complex set of meanings and relationships to other concepts. Recording these associations allows us to put dignity in context in each of these three places. By examining the differences, we can see that while dignity is important everywhere, people’s understanding of it differs. By carefully describing dignity in each place, we advance our own understanding under the Consensus Research Agenda on Dignity and open up the possibility of more accurately designing ways to affirm people’s dignity in each place.
Dignity and fair compensation
What is the relationship between dignity and compensation? Understanding how to compensate people and how that relates to respect for dignity is important for researchers, who debate how to compensate research participants. It is also important for employers: a recent study in the US with more than 9,000 Walmart staff found that when an employee is treated with respect, his likelihood of quitting the job will be reduced as effectively as a 10% wage increase would.
We asked people if they felt they would be treated with respect if they participated in a future research panel. We then asked how much they would expect to be paid. 
Participants in India and the US who felt that they would be treated with more dignity asked for higher wages for future work than did those who anticipated being treated with less dignity. In these places, it seems that those who feel disrespected may feel disempowered to ask that their work be well-compensated - or they may have higher expectations of respect from higher paying workplaces. Studies of dignity will have to take careful account of people’s inbuilt expectations.
But in Nigeria, we see a different pattern: the more people expected their dignity would be respected, the less financial compensation they required for the same amount of work. This echoes the Walmart study described above. In a sense, this demonstrates the extremely high value placed on respect for human dignity among these respondents: recognizing one’s intrinsic worth is, in itself, conferring meaningful value. Economic value becomes less focal when this profound recognition occurs. Meanwhile, respondents in Nigeria demanded recompense for when their dignity was denied.
Conclusion 
If we take dignity seriously – and design development programs, support human rights, and build communities in ways that respect dignity – we also have to take seriously that people do not all experience dignity and respect in the same way. What we share, most importantly, is the conviction that dignity matters in all three of these places. It is our responsibility to listen to the voices of the people with whom we work, and to design for the form of dignity that affirms their very real, and inestimable, intrinsic value. We hope readers will join us both in applying these learnings about dignity to program design in these three contexts and in committing to ongoing learning about dignity in each new context to ensure we show respect in the right ways.

This section outlines the qualifications and eligibility criteria of an ideal implementation partner organization for this study. In addition to the technical and operational capabilities listed below, a key criterion for the selection of the implementation partner will be the alignment with the overarching vision of the research agenda, which places a strong emphasis on dignity and accountability. Prospective partners must demonstrate a shared commitment to these core values.
6.1 Organizational Experience and Capacity
Demonstrated experience in research and evaluations of their programs with successful collaboration with research institutions, governments, and/or international development organizations. Ideally, this capacity is housed internally and exemplified in the existence of a high capacity, internal monitoring, evaluation, and learning team. 
Experience with data collection, management, and analysis in compliance with ethical standards and privacy regulations.
Proven ability to manage complex projects with multiple stakeholders.
6.2 Participant and site information
Program length should ideally be less than one year
Sufficient program scale to ensure the study is well powered given the study design. While final target sample size numbers will be aligned on with the implementation partner in a subsequent step, at this point, IDinsight anticipates a clustered design, which may require program implementation across at least 200-250 communities and 2500 program participants.  As a consequence, the program description  in the RfP response will carry outsized weight. 
Target population should have adequate gender distribution to ensure representativeness.
The organization have existing field staff and resources that can support the research activities
While the geographic scope is global, preference will be given to regions where IDinsight is currently active (India, Africa and South-East Asia)
6.4  Financial and Operational Capacity
Financial stability and the ability to manage funds responsibly and transparently.
Adequate infrastructure and logistical capabilities to carry out the RCT in the chosen locations.
Ability to recruit, train, and manage field staff effectively
6.5  Ethical Compliance
A commitment to upholding the highest ethical standards in research, including obtaining informed consent and ensuring participant confidentiality.
Compliance with all applicable local and international laws and regulations regarding research with human subjects.
6.5  Cultural Sensitivity
Demonstrated cultural competence and sensitivity in working with diverse populations.
Ability to engage with communities respectfully and to communicate effectively across cultural boundaries.

This is the preferred partner qualification suggested in our RFP.",PROJECTS

WIL Conceptual Framework:
I have used IDinsight colors to highlight the boxes, with the IDinsight blue as starting and impact related sections
I changes the arrows as I felt it was more effective to see it this way.
If you need to change anything, you can fully edit the Canva file from this link.
Matrix of interventions:
I also used IDinsight colors, and chose the same colors for the Barriers and Interventions as the WIL conceptual framework graphic, so that there is consistency
I think keeping the table simple like this is effective and doesn’t crowd the content.

4.2 Caregivers are aware of the Care2Play intervention and associate it with WhatsApp activities; however, they do not have a full understanding of the program

We believe it is important to keep the following limitations when reflecting on the awareness levels: 
First Limitation - We only spoke with respondents who were not at risk of attrition, meaning the respondents who were most interested in the program and had the strongest relations with the FLWs. 
Second Limitation - Additionally, C2P program activities occurred simultaneously with the qualitative evaluation. In 7 out of 15 cases, respondents participated in a PEG meeting on the same day or 1-2 days before the interview. Hence, project participants were highly aware of the C2P program. One caregiver explicitly told us they were briefed on the program and instructed by the FLW to remember the information for our interview. 

With this in mind, we should interpret the findings cautiously and keep in mind that they do not give us insights into the awareness levels of less-engaged C2P participants.

General Awareness of C2P - Almost all program participants we interviewed (14 out of 15) were aware of the Care2Play program. 
Participants - Most respondents (11 out of 15) knew the C2P program without probing or explanation. However, a few (3 out of 15) needed clarification about the program, and one respondent could recall the FLWs but was confused about the name “Khelta Bachpan.” 
Nevertheless, during baseline data collection (January 2024), most caregivers were unaware of the C2P program and required an explanation before participating in the interview. We witnessed a similar lack of awareness in the first round of PEG meetings in February 2024. We wanted to highlight that these low levels of awareness were present in the field after five months of field operations (since November 2023). It is worth pointing out that at this stage of the project 34% of participants (17 out of 50) are identified at high risk of attrition. This points to a lower level of awareness among the non-PE participants. 
Spouses - The spouses of C2P participants had mixed awareness. Some (2 out of 6) knew the program, some required a brief explanation (2 out of 6), and others were unaware even upon probing (2 out of 6). 

Awareness of C2P Program Components - C2P participants primarily associated the program with WhatsApp activities, followed by in-person meetings (PEGs and livelihood coaching). Most caregivers were unaware of scheme support even after probing. Spouse awareness around C2P project activities followed the same pattern as C2P participants. 
WhatsApp - The highest recall was of WhatsApp activities - most caregivers mentioned WhatsApp activities without probing (12 out of 15), and after probing, a few caregivers recalled the activities (2 out of 15). It is worth remembering that WhatsApp activities have been sent out since December 2023; hence, respondents were exposed to them for three months before the interview. 
PEGs - Only 2 caregivers mentioned PEG meetings without probing. After an explanation, most caregivers recalled PEGs (9 out of 14). However, even after an explanation, a few of the caregivers were unaware of what PEG meetings are (3 out of 14). 
Until the interview, between three and four PEG sessions occurred: two onboarding sessions (October and November) and one/two thematic sessions (February and March - 3 out of 15 interviews took place before the March PEG round). 7 of our interviewees attended PEG meetings within the last few days, yet they did not associate the program with PEGs. 
Livelihood Coaching - Only 3 caregivers associated the C2P program with livelihood coaching. After probing, most caregivers recalled livelihood coaching as part of the program (10 out of 14). Drawing on our TU interest data, 14 out of 15 of our respondents are in livelihood coaching. 
Welfare Schemes - Few caregivers mentioned welfare schemes without probing (3 out of 14). After an explanation, some caregivers mentioned accessing welfare schemes (5 out of 14); however, some caregivers remained unaware (6 out of 14). Up to date, no meetings dedicated to welfare schemes have taken place, which could contribute to lower awareness. 

Confusion around C2P Program Activities - Although caregivers were aware of the C2P program, they expressed confusion about its activities. 
PEGs and PTMs - Some participants mentioned Parent-Teacher Meetings (PTMs) in relation to the Care2Play program (5 out of 15). Two of these parents explained that they attended PEG meetings because the teacher or principal called and stated they were mandatory. 

“I thought it would be a meeting like how schools usually have meetings. My two children study in the Urdu school, so when the principal called saying there was a meeting at the school today, I thought it must be some school meeting, that's why.”


Caregivers mistaking PEGs for PTMs displays that there is limited comprehension of what PEGs are. A few factors that could contribute to this confusion would be holding PEG meetings in the MCD Urdu School and the presence/involvement of the principal. It is worth considering the implications linked to this - caregivers might be less interested in attending, the content might not match their expectations, and caregivers might perceive PEGs as obligatory, limiting their agency.
PEGs and Livelihood Coaching Sessions - Caregivers were also confused between coaching sessions and PEG meetings. One caregiver mentioned they attended 5 PEG meetings (only four PEG meetings have taken place). Another respondent mentioned that the PEG discussion topic was livelihood, employment and skill building. Initial livelihood coaching sessions took place in groups, which could contribute to the confusion between livelihood sessions and PEGs. 


4.3 Caregivers perceive Care2Play to focus on education rather than play. 

Caregivers did not associate play with the C2P program. This is worth reflecting on, as the conceptualisation of the C2P program centres around play and stimulating environments.

C2P’s Theory of Change assumes that caregivers will create a stimulating environment for children at home if they gain knowledge about the importance of children's well-being, have more time, and achieve financial resilience. We further assume that children’s well-being will improve if exposed to stimulating environments within their communities. We defined well-being as a child’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Nevertheless, the caregivers did not link the C2P intervention with stimulating environments but perceived it as an education-centric program. 

Motivation - 
Joining C2P - Firstly, we didn’t find play to be a motivating factor behind caregivers joining the program. Most respondents mentioned children’s education as the primary motivator (13 out of 15), with most caregivers expressing interest in private school admission via EWS (7). 2 caregivers joined for their personal learning around a child’s development. 8 caregivers mentioned being motivated by livelihood - parents mentioned skill development (5), employment opportunities (2) and financial support (1).
Starting a Business - Caregivers did not mention increased quality time with their children as a reason for participating in livelihood coaching or interest in starting a small business. The main reasons for starting a small business centred around income generation (5), children’s future (3), flexibility (2), or independence (1). Spouses did not mention play or quality time with children as motivation either - husbands’ interest in business was linked to gaining independence (2), income generation (1) or hour flexibility (1). 

Association of Play with C2P  - Additionally, caregivers rarely mentioned play in the context of WhatsApp messages, PEG meetings, or the expected benefit of setting up a business. 
WhatsApp and Play - When asked about the content of WhatsApp messages, caregivers primarily associated them with learning rather than with games. Participants said that the activities centre around maths (8), stories and poems (5), and reading and writing (6). Few caregivers recalled Hindi (3), arts and crafts (2), English (2), games (2) or content on hygiene (1). 
PEGs and Play - The majority of caregivers said that during the PEG session, they discussed topics linked to children (9) - conversation around children’s education (2), children’s development (2), play (2)  or children's well-being (2). Caregivers also mentioned introducing the livelihood program (4) and discussing schemes (2). When asked about the preferred content for discussion in future PEG meetings, only one caregiver mentioned play. Spouses of C2P participants had similar responses, with games mentioned only by a single husband (1 out of 6). 
Livelihood and Play - In caregivers’ opinion, increased financial resilience and setting up a small business do not necessarily translate to spending more time with their children. This challenges one of our key assumptions of the ToC. Most respondents do not think setting up a small business will increase or decrease spending time with their children (9). Caregivers believe it will have no effect as they will work during school hours or at night (4), they will be supported by older children in running the business (1), or they will manage somehow (1). Few parents think this will decrease their time dedicated to their children (3) and make managing time for children and household duties challenging (1). In spouse interviews, respondents believed they would spend less time with their children at the initial stage of setting up the business (2). Overall, spouses think that opening a business would not affect their time with their children (2) and that they would manage (1). One father mentioned that even though the time would be reduced, setting up the business positively impacts the child. No caregiver (participant nor spouse) thinks opening a business will increase their time with their children, even after it stabilises. 

Caregivers on Playing with Children - Even though caregivers do not associate the Care2Play program with play, parents consider play an important part of spending time with their children and, on average, dedicate one hour daily to playing. Parents primarily define quality time with their children as enjoyable time spent together for the parent (4) and the child (2). Caregivers mentioned that quality time should be educational (1) and adjusted to the child's needs (1). Without being prompted, only a few caregivers mentioned that spending quality time is important for a child’s development (3). 

We also asked what types of activities parents do with their children. The majority of caregivers mentioned teaching (including homework, life skills and morals) (10) and playing games (8). Other activities included feeding (5), going out (2), talking about their days (2), reading (1), religious activities (1), looking after health (1), talking (1) or watching TV (1). Spouses mentioned activities such as discussing studies (5), feeding (3), going outdoors (3), playing games (2), discussing morals (1) or joking with the child (1). 

The majority of caregivers said they spend 1.5-3 hours of quality time with their children daily (8). Few parents said they spend more time, ranging between 4 and 6 hours (4). A single parent mentioned that they spend less than 30 minutes per day. We also asked how much time parents spend playing with their children. A few parents said that they don’t play with their children, but rather the children play with their siblings (3 out of 11), a few parents said less than 60 minutes, and a few parents said between 1 and 1.5 hours (3 out of 11), and one parent said between 2 and 3 hours (1 out of 11). One parent could not specify a daily amount and said they play with their child “irregularly” (1 out of 11). Some spouses (5 out of 6) mentioned spending, on average, 1.5-3 hours of quality time with their children daily. A single spouse mentioned 1 hour per day. Two spouses play with their children between 1.5-2 hours (2), while one plays less than 30 minutes daily (1). 

In case of more than one child, parents spend time with their children together (8) rather than splitting time between them (2). We received similar responses from spouses, with the majority spending time with their children together (5 out of 6). One mother and one father mentioned they spend more time with their daughter. 

“Although someone might have three sons, the heart tends to favour one more. I admit I care for all, but my attention is more on the daughter. It usually stays on the daughter because, you see, she is considered someone who will belong to another family. Whatever love she can get from us, and the education we can provide her, whatever we can teach her, we will do as much as we can with her, okay? The son will stay with us for life, but she will leave and come.” 


We also asked how parents would split their time if they had a daughter and a son. A few caregivers mentioned spending time with children together (3) and equally (3). Two mothers mentioned that they spend more time with their younger children. One mother mentioned that she plays differently with her son and daughter but did not elaborate on the activity variation. One spouse said that he spends time together with both children, while another spouse said he splits it equally. 

Enablers and Barriers to Spending Time with Children - Enablers and barriers to spending time with children varied between mothers and fathers. Most mothers mentioned enablers related to having free time (5), children’s holidays (1), elder siblings at school (1), finishing paid work (1), husbands coming back home early (1), or cold weather outside (1). Interestingly, fathers’ main enablers were linked to having more free time from their jobs (3) or regular working hours (1). 

Mothers’ main barriers to spending time with children were paid work (3), housework (3), children’s tuition or madrasa (3), health (2), or being outside of the house (2). Fathers’ barriers were not having time due to paid work (5) or health problems in the family (1). Mothers’ barriers centred more around the child’s schedule and availability, while fathers’ barriers were primarily due to their occupation. 

Overall, caregivers do not associate play with our intervention. Spending quality time or playing with children was not mentioned in the context of PEG meetings, WhatsApp messages or as a potential motivator behind setting up a small business. Nevertheless, caregivers consider play important and spend quality time with their children daily. 

4.4 Early experiences of the program have been positive among the highly active caregivers

WhatsApp Experience - Almost all caregivers have smartphones and are part of WhatsApp groups (14 out of 15). Only one respondent does not have a smartphone in their household but owns a button phone. All caregivers with smartphone access said that they receive WhatsApp activities. However, a few caregivers were confused about which WhatsApp group they belonged to and required clarifications (2 out of 14). Interestingly, all the spouses of C2P participants were also aware of the WhatsApp activities. 

It is important to point out that the digital literacy of our PE respondents differs from the digital literacy skills of other C2P program participants. PE respondents have higher digital literacy skills - on average, PE respondents scored 7.3 points on the digital literacy assessment (out of 12), as opposed to all C2P participants’ average of 6.5. The points have been calculated based on the ability of a respondent to fully complete a given task (not partially). Please refer to Chart 2 for a detailed breakdown of the digital literacy assessment scores between PE and all C2P participants. This should be considered when interpreting the following findings as it can suggest that they are more comfortable using WhatsApp, taking and sending photos, may have different preferences and face fewer challenges linked to technology. 

Chart 2. Digital literacy skills of PE respondents and non-PE respondents




When triangulating PE data with Rocket Learning’s engagement data, we found that 3 out of 14 caregivers have never sent a message on the WhatsApp group. The 11 remaining caregivers had sent a total of 239 messages, averaging 22 messages per respondent. It is important to note that this is much higher than the average number of messages sent by active participants on the WhatsApp groups - among 79 active users, the total number of messages sent is 993, with 13 messages on average per parent. Please refer to Table 1 for additional information. The monthly breakdown of digital engagement can be found in Appendix C.

The majority of the interviewees could explain the content of the messages (9 out of 13). Few caregivers were confused or unable to explain the messages they received via WhatsApp (4 out of 13). Participants mentioned the activities come as videos (6) and photos (3). Almost all of the C2P participant spouses could also describe the content of WhatsApp messages (5 out of 6). 

Few parents found the activities easy to understand (6), but others struggled with comprehension (4). Most spouses responded alike - 4 found the activities easy, while 2 faced challenges. 

Children find the activities easy (7) but sometimes require parents to explain. Few children sometimes find the activities difficult (5), with specific challenges linked to maths (2). Alongside comprehension, caregivers mentioned that they struggle to dedicate time to the activities as they are busy (3). Other challenges linked to the completion of WhatsApp activities were health problems (1), limited phone access (1), being recently added to the WhatsApp group (1), phone damage (1), or technical challenges (1). Some challenges may also be linked to children - children face challenges with activities when they have exams (2) or are not in the mood to conduct the activities (1). The most frequently identified barrier by spouses was children not being in the mood to complete the activities (3).

Caregivers found the activities useful (12), as they help children with learning (7), complement the school curriculum (2), and allow children to learn through play (2). One caregiver mentioned mixed usefulness as they are repetitive across school content and tuition. Another caregiver suggested including more educational content with interactive activities rather than videos children can watch passively. It is interesting to caveat this finding with our baseline results, where 24% of respondents (strongly) disagreed with the statement that smartphones can enhance children’s learning and development. This indicator was even higher when we looked at PE respondents, amounting to 33%. This data was collected in January 2024, after ~2 months of caregivers receiving digital activities. Even with a negative perception of technology’s impact on children, PE respondents are completing the WhatsApp activities and finding them useful. 

Some caregivers support the children in completing the WhatsApp activities (6 out of 13). In other cases, elder siblings complete activities with the child (3), the spouse (3), the grandparent (1) or other relatives (1). Few caregivers said that the child completes the activities alone and does not get any support (4). Interestingly, during the spouse interview, respondents mentioned that the FLWs complete WhatsApp activities with children during their home visits (2). Parents also stated other children in the family complete the WhatsApp activities, not only the child in the target grade (5).

Children complete the activities frequently - 5 out of 15 caregivers said that their children complete activities 3-4 times per week or more often. 2 caregivers mentioned the frequency of 1-3 times per week. Few caregivers do not remember (1), never complete them (1) or complete them twice in total (1). Additionally, few caregivers explicitly mentioned that when completing the activities, they send the photos back (4). Nevertheless, as shown earlier, this level of engagement is much higher than the average C2P program participant. 

FLWs Interactions - All caregivers have interacted with an FLW at least once (15 out of 15). The frequency of interactions with FLWs varied among caregivers. Few caregivers mentioned that they interacted with the FLW more than once per month (6), while some mentioned they interacted between 4-6 times (8). All caregivers said they interacted with multiple FLWs (12 out of 12). The main locations of interactions have been Gandhi Park (14), MCD school (11), and at home (5). 

During FLW interactions, caregivers discussed children (7), specifically children’s education (5), children’s future (2), activities to do with children (2), children's development or behaviours (2) or play (1). Many discussions also centred around livelihood topics (8), such as vision building (8), savings (1) or opening a business (1). A few caregivers mentioned welfare schemes (4), specifically RTE (2) or BoCW (1).

Most caregivers felt comfortable interacting with FLWs (11 out of 15). 3 caregivers had feelings of mixed comfort, while one caregiver felt uncomfortable. Almost all caregivers trust the FLWs (14 out of 15), while 1 caregiver does not feel trust. The primary reason behind trust is the belief that FLWs work for caregivers’ benefit (3). Most caregivers could speak about an example of a respectful interaction they had with FLWs - no caregiver shared an example of a disrespectful situation. It is important to note that FLWs were often in close proximity during the interviews; hence, the respondents might not have felt comfortable fully opening up about their experiences. 

PEG Experience - PEG attendance varied among the most engaged C2P caregivers. Some caregivers have never attended a PEG meeting (3), few caregivers attended a single meeting (5), while few caregivers stated they attended PEG meetings twice (4). 

We compared the attendance of PE participants to the attendance levels of non-PE participants. PE participants have a much higher average attendance, with 73% having attended at least one meeting as opposed to 34% of non-PE participants. Please refer to more information in Table 2.

Caregivers attended PEG meetings primarily because this was the FLWs’ suggestion (3) or the teacher had called and required them to attend (2). Other parents were encouraged by their spouses (1) or were motivated to learn more about sewing for livelihood opportunities (1). 

All caregivers who attended the PEG meetings had a positive experience (11 out of 11). Three caregivers mentioned they enjoyed learning new information, while one enjoyed drawing. No caregiver said that they had a neutral or negative experience. However, 2 caregivers mentioned that they didn't find the discussion useful, of which 1 did not find it interesting. Most respondents said they felt comfortable asking questions during the PEG meeting (8 out of 10), while 2 respondents did not feel comfortable. They felt shy in the group setting with other mothers. 

“Interviewer - Why can't you ask? Respondent - It feels like, whether they will listen or not, there are other mothers too, that's why I don't ask”. Participants could have felt shy as these were the first two PEG meetings and likely their first interactions with the caregiver group. 


4.5 Caregivers value community connections and are interested in setting up small businesses and scheme applications

Among the 104 initially interested caregivers, 54 refused participation in the baseline survey and enrolment in the C2P program. Caregivers refused because they were no longer interested in the C2P program (21 out of 54), they did not respond to more than 3 FLWs’ phone attempts (8 out of 51), or they were not eligible as they do not have children attending the MCD Urdu School (8 out of 51). The detailed reasons for refusals and low conversion rate are included in Appendix B.  

Hence, when discussing interests and needs for the C2P program, it is important to note that we are only referring to caregivers who are enrolled and highly engaged in the program. We only discuss the needs of a selective group of caregivers who differ systematically from the broader pool of C2P participants. 

WhatsApp Preferences - Caregivers and spouses would like to receive more activities via WhatsApp focusing on studies, primarily English. Most caregivers, both participants and spouses, prefer to receive activities more frequently. Among C2P participants, 6 out of 12 caregivers suggested daily, and 2 out of 12 caregivers suggested 4-5 times per week. Few caregivers mentioned that the message frequency should remain as is (4 out of 12), and a single caregiver said that increasing the frequency will have a negative impact on children’s learning. Caregivers prefer the activities to centre around studies (7). 6 C2P participants and 3 spouses mentioned more content in English. Caregivers were also interested in maths activities (2), Hindi (1), and Sanskrit (1). Single-spouse respondents also mentioned content around health (1) and children’s future aspirations (1). 

Spouses also offered a few suggestions for improving the WhatsApp messages. They suggested simplifying the answer choices (1), advancing the levels of tasks with children’s progress (1) and shortening the length of activities (1). 

PEGs - All C2P participants would attend future PEG meetings (14 out of 14). Caregivers would like to attend in the future because they found the information useful (2), or attendance allows them to show they care for their child’s wellbeing (1). In future PEG meetings, caregivers would like to discuss topics related to children (7), specifically children’s education (6), development (1) or play (1). There was also a strong preference to discuss livelihood topics (8), and a few caregivers mentioned welfare schemes (2).

Drawing on our baseline survey, 72% of C2P participants (N: 50) mentioned they would be available for PEG meetings at least twice per month (27% would be available four times, and 45% would be available twice per month). 27% of respondents said they would be available once per month, and 2% said once every two months. There is an important distinction between the availability of C2P participants and PE participants. More than half of PE participants (53%)  indicated they would be available for PEGs four times per month, while 33% said they would be available twice per month. Only 13% stated that they would attend once per month. PE participants prefer more frequent PEG meetings, pointing to further differences between their interests and preferences from the broader C2P population. Please refer to Chart 3 for more details. 


Chart 3. PEG Frequency Preference of PE respondents and non-PE respondents




We found that caregivers value community interactions - the majority of caregivers said that community is important to them (12 out of 15). A few C2P participants mentioned that they carry a medium importance (2), while one caregiver said they are not important. Among the spouses, the perception was similar - 5 out of 6 spouses value having a close-knit community. Caregivers expect their community to support them with child care (4), food (3), or finances (2). Caregivers also mentioned support linked to mental health (1), personal issues (1), school matters (1), or health emergencies (1). Spouses mentioned that the community can support them in times of need (3), with matters related to children (2) or health (2). We can link this back to our baseline survey to understand the perception of community among all C2P caregivers. In the baseline survey, 80% of PE participants said community plays an important role in a child’s early growth, as opposed to 90% of all C2P participants. Hence, among all C2P participants, the community may be perceived as more important than our qualitative findings suggest. 

Nevertheless, even though the community is perceived as valuable, caregivers do not have strong relations in their current networks. Some caregivers said they know multiple people in their community/neighbourhood well and frequently contact them if they need support (5).  Few caregivers mentioned that they know a couple of their neighbours, and they rarely reach out to them for support (4). Other caregivers said they do not know more than 1-2 people in their community and do not reach out to them (6). Notably, almost all spouses of the participants stated that they interact with their community but do not have very close relationships (5 out of 6). 

A gap exists between caregivers’ value perception of the community and their existing relations. It is interesting to note that PEG meetings were conceptualised as parents' networks for “building capacity, assets and connection of caregivers” and a forum to “deliver social and economic inclusion programming to strengthen individual and family wellbeing that translates to better nutritional, educational and psychological outcomes for children”. It is too early in the project to assess whether PEGs would fulfil this role; however, parents value community networks and see them as support systems in their day-to-day lives. PEGs could fill the gap and act as a forum, enabling caregivers to form stronger community connections. 

Livelihood Coaching Sessions - Drawing on our baseline survey, we find that 20% of PE respondents are employed, as opposed to 32% of all C2P participants. Hence, the needs and preferences of the PE respondents might differ from those of the other C2P participants. Unemployed individuals may express more interest in livelihood coaching and business set-up and be able to dedicate more time to it than employed caregivers. Additionally, the parents we spoke with have participated in more skill training than other C2P participants. 73% of our PE respondents took up skill training in the past, as opposed to 46% among all C2P participants.

Caregivers expressed interest in livelihood sessions (14 out of 15). Caregivers are interested in building their livelihood plans (10), with the majority wanting to focus on sewing (9 out of 10). Some caregivers (5) want to learn more about digital literacy; however, few caregivers aren’t interested (2). Some caregivers are also interested in learning more about savings (3), while some actively said they are not (2). 2 caregivers would like to learn more about loans. Almost all caregivers want to start a business (12 out of 13). One caregiver is not interested as they have a small baby. Among the spouses, 4 out of 6 respondents were interested in livelihood coaching, specifically in a livelihood plan (1) and digital literacy (1). 5 out of 6 spouses are interested in setting up small businesses such as a hotel (1), import-export business (1) or a grocery store (1). One spouse mentioned they would set up a business with partners (1). 

Caregivers (8) and spouses (3) prefer individual coaching sessions around livelihoods once a week. Some caregivers mentioned that they are flexible about the frequency of the coaching sessions (3). 

Livelihood coaching and business set-up could support caregivers in increasing their financial income and improving their resilience. Most caregivers (11) said they do not have sufficient income to cover their children’s basic needs, particularly linked to education (primarily tuition) (7), nutrition (3), toys (1) or clothes (1). If caregivers have additional monthly funds of 5000 INR, they would primarily save it (6) for business (1) or health emergencies (1). Few mothers said that they would spend it on a children’s education (4), house purchase (3), food (1), or clothes (1). Most spouses also said they do not have sufficient income to cover children’s expenses (4 out of 5), while one father said they can “just manage”. The basic needs that spouses are not able to cover include tuition (2), education at a good school (2) or health accidents (1). With an additional 5000 INR, spouses would decide to save it (2), spend it on their children’s future (2), children’s tuition (1) or their business (1). 

Welfare Schemes - The majority of caregivers are interested in applying for welfare schemes (9 out of 15), while few are unsure (4 out of 15), and a single caregiver is not interested. Most caregivers expressed interest in RTE (9); however, this could also be a function of their scheme awareness and perception of this program as education-centric. Some caregivers expressed interest in receiving a ration card (2), and single caregivers expressed interest in the Sukanya Samridhi Yojana (1) and schemes linked to gas/electricity (1). Caregivers would like to receive more information about schemes (4), be supported with documentation (4), and the application process (2). Few caregivers mentioned that they would appreciate any form of support (3). Spouses would like a similar type of support - any support around the application process (2), receiving information (1) or checking the application status (1). Most spouses have also expressed interest in scheme applications (4 out of 5), particularly education schemes (2), BoCW (1), and Ayushman card (1). 

Most caregivers have applied for welfare schemes in the past (12 out of 15), with few caregivers having applied to multiple schemes (5). When we asked about the types of schemes applied for, the majority of caregivers were unable to recall the names, for example, “Interviewer - So, do you know which specific scheme it was from, which scheme or plan? Respondent - Don't know which one it was, it was some hospital, we had the operation done there, I mean, the child was there, got it from there”. Caregivers have applied for BoCW (3), JSY (3), RTE (2), and PMMVY (2). 3 caregivers have not applied for any schemes. Some spouses have applied for schemes, while two have not. It was not always clear which schemes respondents applied for; however, spouses mentioned RTE (1), labour card (1), JSY (1), MGNREGA (1) and “subsidies from the Bihar government” (1). 

We can ground these insights in our baseline data - among 50 families, 5 families have children currently enrolled in the RTE scheme (10%). Regarding the BoCW scheme, 14 families have construction workers (28%), of which 2 have active labour cards. In relation to PMMVY, there is only one pregnant woman in the families of the C2P participants. Indicators around caregivers’ proofs of caste, children’s age, income, and address can be found in Appendix B. 

Caregivers’ experiences around scheme application have been mixed. Some caregivers had a positive experience and faced no challenges (3), while others had a negative experience (3). The main challenges faced were linked to documentation (3), delays in the process (3), availing benefits (2), rejections (2), travel to different locations for the application (2), accessing the government website (1), admin issues (1), or not receiving a response (1). Some caregivers mentioned they received benefits from their scheme applications (3), while 1 did not. 

The experiences of spouses have been both positive (1) and negative (1). Few spouses faced challenges linked to documentation (3), bribes (3), and benefits (2). One spouse availed of the benefit (1), while another did not (1). 

Overall, PEGs have the potential to act as a forum for caregivers to build their community connections. Caregivers are interested in setting up small businesses and developing financial resilience, as many caregivers do not have sufficient financial resources to fulfil their children’s basic needs. Additionally, caregivers have experience applying for schemes and are interested in future applications, especially with support. 
- and these are my recommendations - 

Recommendations


Based on the findings from the qualitative interviews, we have provided a set of program design and implementation recommendations. It is essential 

6.1 Relationship building and program comprehension

Firstly, we recommend dedicating time and resources to outreach and relationship-building between FLWs and caregivers. This could be conducted via PEG meetings or individual home visits. One point of contact could be assigned to each caregiver to build a relationship of trust and comfort. 
Secondly, outreach and relationship building should inform participants about all project components - Whatsapp activities, PEG meetings, livelihood coaching, and welfare schemes. There should be larger focus on awareness building around welfare schemes. Participants should also be more aware of livelihood meetings and PEG meetings. 
Lastly, when introducing the program, FLWs should ensure that caregivers understand that all components are voluntary, specifically that PEG meetings are not mandatory and should not be referred to as PTMs. 

6.2 Rethinking the role of play in our intervention 

Caregivers express the need for the program, but they do not perceive it as a play-centred program. We would recommend reflecting on - 
What is the role of “play” in our current program design? 
What role would we like “play” to have in our overall design when the demand of caregivers centres around education?

Additionally, we would recommend further reflecting on one of the key assumptions from our Theory of Change - “If caregivers become financially resilient, they will have more time to spend with children”. Our early insights suggest that setting up a business will lead to a decreased time or no effect on the time spent with children. We would recommend further reflections around - 
How can setting up a business enable caregivers to spend more time with their children? 

6.3 PEGs to be community-centric rather than a separate institution

PEGs can act as a forum for parents to build their caregiver networks. PEGs could be approached as a space to build trust and share challenges. Especially in the early meetings, it is important to ensure caregivers feel comfortable and are encouraged to speak up. 
Conducting team-building activities to build up caregiver networks gradually
Discussing challenges faced by caregivers with the program content - in the initial days, this would be specifically relevant for WhatsApp activities and technical challenges.
Encouraging caregivers’ to take up ownership over the PEG meetings to ensure long-term sustainability - for example, identifying and working with caregiver champions.

6.4  Adjusting the program content to caregivers’ needs

We should be careful in adjusting the program design to caregivers’ preferences as our interviews were conducted with a specific subset of respondents - the most active respondents. Nevertheless, it is worth taking their suggestions and feedback into account and discussing it in potential group settings, e.g. PEG meetings: 
Sending more studies-focussed content via WhatsApp, with a larger focus on English
Meeting with caregivers weekly to discuss their livelihood coaching and organising skill-building activities in sewing
Informing participants about the schemes they are eligible for, supporting them through the documentation process and with applications.
 I want to have an introductory paragraph in recommendations that links the section to the findings. use short, concise language and active voice. ",PROJECTS

Leadership Updates
Frida: Last AHM covered questions on the pause on retreats and shift in financial strategy. Promise for more clarity in the coming weeks. Overall message of “we hear you.”
Wants to reiterate that as an organization is in good financial position. Organisation has 6 months financial buffer. Acknowledges that onset communication could have been more clear from the beginning, but reiterates that we are in a good finance position, no need to panic. 
Kashif: Questions: India still having their retreat? Frida: Not in a position to speak to it fully. There are different factors such as India not having a retreat for a while, and decentralized decisions, that would warrant the retreat still going on. 
Sylvia: 
Adds: As more information becomes available around change in financial direction, it will be shared. 
In the absence of a retreat - Call to participate in the SCC events, and continue to strengthen our office culture and bond. 
Will be working with the SCC to fill in the gap of the retreat with some new direction.  Does not want to pre-empt direction - Leaning on Mulenga and team. Expectation is for all office members to be receptive and participate.
Reminder for office norms on timeliness, on dress code, on attendance of off-office events. Let Sylvia (or interim lead) know of absence in advance - does not have to be detailed.  
Natasha: 
Feedback on regional meetings. 
Pipeline has been reprioritized.

Project Spotlight - SHOFCO (Judy and Alison)
Q&A
Frazer: Q: Did they have any dashboards. A: Internal dashboards. There was a discussion to share some dashboards. Main 
Jeff: 1) Is there any paklan for team to follow up with sofco in usage 2) is there any plan on future engagement, if not why not. Alison: In terms of follow up, nothing is planned. Certain programs liek wash, and gender, and were already using shaofco. Good suggestion to think about when to follow up next. Hope is if some programs are seeing/utilizing value, that more programs will uptake dashboard use. Continues engagement is currently no. There has been a lot of turnover, some program scoping alternative MIS support, complex to engage - as SOFCo stabilizes internal data system, open to engagement. Had prior successful evaluation engagement prior… So as more opportunities surface in the future, happy teenagers. Jeff: IIT great to loop in. 
Mulenga: With all the changes in scope, how was the budget navigated? Alison: It was within budget… We had built in a lot of senior time that was not utilized until a certain point. Rachel staggered when to bring on associates. 
Rico: MEL, was it set up as a learning partnership or fixed as MEL? Lesson learned looked familiar. How can realistically scope out changes better, since many projects. Alison: Was not involved in client dev conversation. Was not a learning partnership. Our client was Paul and was looking to find a learning partnership, and it was a challenge to pushback. It is important to define scope as concretely as possible define what IDi’s end product will be. Scoping what the data expectations, data needs, what would IDi need to support, or be suited for IDi to support. Could have better sequenced activities if these were known up front. """,PROJECTS

2185,2024-04-23,8e6aa4f0-a390-4aaf-815a-b815aaeba399,9642,,,"The Zambia National Blood Transfusion Service (ZNBTS) is a statutory body under the Ministry of Health, established under statutory Instrument 147 of 1997 and is mandated to spearhead the coordination and implementation of the National Blood Safety Strategy. ZNBTS is centrally coordinated but sufficiently decentralised to render services to all hospitals. It has a presence in all ten provinces of Zambia through its operational centres called Provincial Blood Transfusion Centres. Specifically, ZNBTS is responsible for blood donor recruitment, blood collection, and care for blood donors, including counselling, screening for infectious agents, serological blood grouping and storage of units of donated blood, the preparation of blood components to provide needed blood coagulation support for mothers in distress, and distribution of blood and blood components to hospital blood banks, including the University Teaching Hospital (UTH). The blood and blood components produced include whole blood, red cell concentrates, fresh frozen plasma, platelet concentrates and cryoprecipitate. In 2023, ZNBTS signed a 5-year memorandum of understanding to collaborate with IDinsight to find data-driven solutions to address Zambia’s chronic blood shortage.
Zambia has been experiencing chronic blood shortages country-wide over the last decade. As shown in Figure 1 below, the gap between national blood needs and actual blood collection has widened. ZNBTS met up to 80% of blood needs between 2013 and 2016. However, the introduction of specialised medical services between 2016 and 2017 led to a sharp increase in blood needed to cover new specialised services within the country (e.g. open heart surgery. This subsequently led to a decline in national blood needs met from collections from 80% to 38% as of 2022. This chronic blood shortage has negative impacts on patient groups that rely on blood transfusion in Zambia, including, but not limited to, patients undergoing surgery and those with hemorrhagic conditions or other causes of anaemia. Other causes of the blood shortage include a lack of an established donor recruitment, retention and recall strategy that would ensure a reliable blood donor base, reliance on an unpredictable population of first-time blood donors who are inconsistent in responding to donation requests, and myths and misconceptions about blood donation. 1.2 Rationale for Study
Recognising the critical blood shortage, ZNBTS has elevated the blood unit target to 400,000, representing 2% of Zambia’s population. To achieve the set targets, ZNBTS aims to expand blood donation efforts and enhance donor retention. The blood service is requesting data on blood donors and non-donors so it can better understand the landscape of blood donation in Zambia and achieve its goals using a data-driven approach.
1.3 Significance
There is very little research on the attitudes and practices of blood donors in Zambia. This study will equip ZNBTS with unique, evidence-based donor and non-donor profiles to design targeted interventions to convert non-donors into donors and existing donors into repeat donors. This information will be timely as ZNBTS is looking to:
Develop updated marketing strategies
Build strategies to retain 200,000 regular repeating donors
Consistently collect 400,000 units annually
Setup a national donor call centre optimised to keep donors engaged and accessible for urgent needs 
1.4 Aim
This study will generate new large-scale data on blood donation in Zambia to inform ZNBTS’ new multi-year strategy. IDinsight will study blood donors and non-donors in Zambia to better understand what motivates people to donate and what prevents others from donating and gain insights on how to increase blood donation. This data will lead to new messaging and campaigning by ZNBTS around Zambia to increase blood donations.
1.5 Specific Objectives
The objectives of this study are to: 
Understand the profiles of blood donors and non-donors
Understand the expectations and attitudes of voluntary blood donors
Understand attitudes of non-donors
Gain insights on how to find and retain donors We will adhere to the three key principles in the Belmont Report, which are meant to inform the selection of participants, the informed consent process, and the assessment of risks imposed on participants.
Respect for persons: This requires treating research participants as autonomous individuals who should not be coerced or unduly induced into participating, who should be guaranteed privacy and confidentiality, and who should be treated with courtesy and respect. This principle is operationalised primarily by requiring that participants go through an informed consent process to learn about the full extent of the research, presenting it comprehensively and truthfully. We include copies of the informed consent forms in Appendix 1, 2 and 3.
Beneficence: Beneficence requires that the benefits of the study to society and participants outweigh any risks to the research participants. This principle is operationalised by simultaneously minimising risk and ensuring that the research leads to knowledge that could be used to improve health and well-being. We believe that our study meets these criteria, given the low risk to participants who are surveyed and the lack of quality data on the attitudes towards blood donation in Zambia.
Justice: This requires a fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of research, including the burdens of participation and the benefits from evidence-based interventions that may eventually result from the research. This principle is operationalised by ensuring that the population participating in the study is representative of future beneficiaries of generalisable knowledge and that research procedures are administered equally, fairly, and in a non-exploitative manner. We believe that our research meets this criteria as we will randomly select blood donors and non-donors to survey from the larger population of interest; the benefits of increased blood supply in Zambia will affect everyone in the country; and all evaluation staff will treat study participants with respect.
In addition to adhering to these principles, all IDinsight research staff have completed human subjects training within the last three years.
Ethical Risks and Ways to Minimize Them
The main risk to respondents that we anticipate is the sharing and communication of personal or sensitive information in potentially vulnerable situations (such as family socioeconomic and health-realted information).
Our research design includes surveying students in grades 11 and 12. To survey students under 18, we will acquire consent from the relevant District Education Board Secretary and each participating school. We have appended a school-level informed consent form to this application, which will be provided to each Head Teacher of the participating schools. Obtaining school-level consent is in line with ZNBTS’ existing protocols on student blood donation, where they obtain consent from the school to collect blood, rather than parents or guardians. Students will be surveyed within a school leader designated place that will be open to ensure visibility for the students while ensuring their privacy.
Data collection, management and review and analysis will be conducted by the PIs, including a review of the quality of data against ADS 203 data quality criteria (validity, reliability, timeliness, precision, and integrity); data collection will be reassigned to the field-based data collector if corrections are required. Some of the respondents’ answers might touch on sensitive topics related to their personal lives and opinions. We will provide the respondents with relevant country information or helplines as applicable and available in the country, outlined in the consent forms and survey instruments. In addition, we will work with our partner organisations, ZNBTS, PDU and MoH, to identify the right contacts. If the respondent expresses extreme distress during the survey, we will train the surveyors to immediately pause the survey, reassure and empathise with the respondent. Finally, we will provide each surveyor with a written document that contains all this information.
Overview of Data Handling and Security
Identifiable information in the data will only be accessible by IDinsight’s project team, the IDinsight enumeration team, and the ZNBTS PIs included in this application. After data collection, all individually identifiable information will be encrypted on IDinsight’s data servers for use within IDinsight. Before sharing any data with other members of the ZNBTS team, we will remove all identifying variables or information that can be used to identify individual respondents.

I hope everything is well with you!

I am writing this email to facilitate a connection between <https://www.idinsight.org/where-we-work/our-offices/rabat/|IDinsight Morocco>, a data and evidence organization dedicated to helping global development leaders maximize their social impact,and ICG Jordan.

First of all, I'd like to introduce my colleagues <https://www.idinsight.org/person/estelle-plat/|Estelle Plat> and <https://www.idinsight.org/person/essaid-azzouzi/|Essaid Azzouzi>, both Directors at IDinsight, <https://www.idinsight.org/person/hamza-zakraoui/|Hamza Zakraoui>, Associate Director and Chief of Staff for the West and North Africa Region, and <https://www.idinsight.org/person/amine-messaoudi/|Amine Messaoudi>, Regional Communications Officer for the West and North Africa Region.

Our team is trying to lay the groundwork for potential work and initiatives that could amplify our impact in the Middle East region. Would you be open to an introductory chat to discuss the work ICG does in Jordan and some insights you might have into working in the region? If so, do you have a preference in terms of the date and time to connect? As I'll be on leave next week, my colleague <mailto:hamza.zakraoui@idinsight.org|@Hamza Zakraoui> will be happy to arrange the details with you.

2326,2024-04-26,2400a681-0898-418a-85c8-2e2f71a214c7,10340,,,"Can you rephrase this paragraph by keeping studies that shows positive evidence and those showing limited evidence for causality between using a savings product and use of agricultural inputs separate?

""However, the evidence around the causality between the utilization of savings products and the use of agricultural inputs remains mixed, even within agricultural contexts. While some interventions have proven successful, others have not demonstrated a clear impact. This inconsistency may be due to variations in whether and how outcomes were measured. A randomized intervention studied by Brune and al. aimed at facilitating formal savings for agricultural inputs among Malawian farmers showed a rise in agricultural input usage. In this study, treatment group participants were offered the opportunity to have their cash crop harvest proceeds directly deposited into newly established bank accounts held in their own names. In contrast, the control group received harvest payments in cash, replicating the existing practice. The analysis revealed that the intervention led to an increase in savings and also demonstrated a rise in agricultural input usage for the subsequent season. The study also finds positive treatment effects on subsequent crop sale proceeds and household expenditures. It showed that a commitment savings program for agricultural inputs, which experienced a 20% uptake, led to a 13.3% rise in input utilization. Similarly, a study from Duflo et al. (2011) addressing commitment problems that prevent farmers from saving for fertilizer purchases via small limited-time vouchers at harvest in Western Kenya found a rise in the adoption of fertilizer by 14%. Nonetheless, the absolute scale of fertilizer or input usage remained notably limited in both instances.
This finding is not only limited to the demand for inputs. Casaburi and Macchiavello (2019) find that dairy farmers in Kenya exhibit a strong demand for deferred payments (a form of saving commitments mechanism) for selling the milk they produce, even when the price is lower than the money they could receive upfront. This demand primarily stems from the need to manage irregular expenses such as animal feeds and agricultural inputs. Nevertheless, the connection between savings products to increased profits and yields is unclear, and similar results have been found for expanding access to credit (only one of the nine randomized evaluations found increases in farmer profit). Notably, a randomized controlled trial that created collaborative savings groups in Mali (no infusion of external capital) found increased consumption smoothing and food security, and only suggestive evidence of higher agricultural output. 
Altogether, constraints on borrowing and saving seem to affect production decisions, but are just some of the binding constraints faced by farmers in Africa. Table 1 describes these results. """,PROJECTS

The implementation partner identified through this RFP will play a critical role in the execution of the RCT. The scope of work includes a comprehensive set of tasks and responsibilities that the partner will undertake to ensure the successful implementation and evaluation of the interventions.
3.1 Expectations from the Implementation Partner
The implementation partner will be expected to:
Participate in the selection of a package of dignity intervention from the possible intervention list that is feasible to be implemented in their own programs.
Collaborate with IDinsight in finalizing the intervention designs and ensuring they are culturally and contextually appropriate, including through small scale pilots if required.
Participate in the development of and in managing a detailed project plan, including timelines, milestones, and resource allocation.
Recruit and/or train field staff to deliver the interventions ensuring adherence to ethical standards and research protocols.
Implement the interventions according to the agreed-upon methodology, maintaining high fidelity to the intervention design.
Develop a regular progress report mechanism with IDinsight to keep track of challenges encountered and adjustments made
Support the data collection and analysis of the data and the dissemination of findings.
3.2 Description of the Work to be Performed
The work to be performed by the implementation partner will include:
Staff Training: Preparing and conducting training sessions for field staff.
Stakeholder Engagement: Coordinating with local stakeholders and community leaders to facilitate the smooth delivery of interventions.
Monitoring and Reporting: Monitoring the progress of the interventions and making necessary adjustments.
Results and Analysis: Supporting IDinsight in the interpretation of results and preparation of reports and publications
3.3 Roles and Responsibilities
We envision to divide roles and responsibilities as follows:
IDinsight will:
Design the RCT methodology and develop the study design
Support adapting existing tools and resources to be more context-specific  
Provide overall guidance and oversight during the implementation of the interventions.
Provide required technical support
Analyze data and disseminate findings.
Implementation Partner will:
Pilot a short-list of selected interventions as required
Integrate a final package of dignity-focused interventions into their programming (for a select-study area)
Implement the adapted program in agreed-upon study areas over the course of the study period 
Support data collection and preliminary data management.
Maintaining responsible communication channels with the participants
Communicating any changes and developments on the ground that may affect the RCT measurement and outcomes 
We aspire to build this partnership on open communication, mutual respect, and a shared commitment to achieving the objectives of the study.

“Section on Contents
For the Forward section, thank you for suggesting the section on the statement from BMGF leadership. So you know, it can take a lot of time and several levels of review to get official statements like this. Let’s keep the placeholder for now, but we’re not sure exactly what this will look like in the final document.
Please include a section to define any acronyms you use.
You may also consider having an up-front section with a glossary of definitions, for those less familiar with MLE (alternatively, it may be easier to just define them in the text)
 
Section 1/Section 2
Overall, we recommend shortening the up-front sections so the document has more of a focus on the indicator matrix
Section 1 and section 2, and potentially section 3.1 can likely be combined into one section.
We understand that developing the Theory of Change and Matrix of interventions were key steps in developing background knowledge for the indicators – so would recommend framing work briefly as part of the background or methodology.
Would recommend that, as part of methodology, you mention that close work with WIL team was part of developing these frameworks.
However, for the TOC graphic, please remove the label “BMGF WIL strategy goals” from the green box. The team is in the process of updating their goals internally, so we should avoid this language for now. These could be re-labeled something like “Illustrative final outcomes”
 We anticipate that the “interventions” table would raise a lot of questions for the reader, such as, “have the interventions here been tested, and shown to reduce the associated barriers?” Please describe the process you used to determine which barriers got checkpoints for what interventions. Either cite sources here, or explain that sources will be cited in their respective sections.
In the methods section, please explain the decision to organize the compendium by intervention.
As part of your methods section, please include one-two lines that summarizes IDI’s engagement with WIL partners in informing this report, specifically to account for the MLE session at the London WIL Convening + follow-up workshops in India and Kenya. If we decide to pursue additional WIL partners engagement to inform the Compendium draft, you can build in additional language later to reflect that.
 
Measures and Indicators Section
 We would like to see sections on illustrative final outcomes (such as increased women’s leadership) and impact.
The ToC graphic identifies illustrative final outcomes. Please include a section with indicators which could be used to measure these. The GH5050 reports, for example, include options relevant to some of the indicators.
For Impact outcomes, include the two SDG 5.5 sub indicators (political representation and managerial positions).
Please write out the sources, as opposed to just including links
We assume that you have left out the “validation” information as many of these indicators have not been validated. At the very least, it would be helpful to see names of programs who have already used the indicators, and the contexts in which they use them. Consider adding another column with this information.”",PROJECTS

I think one of Abhishek’s key strengths is generating constructive and insightful inputs. He encourages conversations around the broader project, current workstreams, linking our program to challenges in the development field and critically assessing what we could be doing better/differently. An example of an important discussion Abhishek has raised within the team were fundraising initiatives of the C2P partner organization, before our implementation has fully kicked off. Abhishek is also able to look at the higher-level picture of the program and reflect on the need and impact. An example of this is the conversation we are currently having is around pushing our process evaluation timelines.

I think Abhishek does an excellent job structuring and providing feedback on deliverables. Quality of Abhishek’s written deliverables is very high and he is able to pinpoint which areas I should focus on for improvement. I have personally felt like the quality of my work has improved since working closely with Abhishek on grant proposals, presentations or structuring workshop flows. Abhishek remains extremely responsive in terms of feedback, inputs and any queries.

In the Lego C2P project, we work with four consortium partners. One skill that Abhishek has showcased, has been his ability to find a balance between IDinsight pushing the consortium’s work forward, while simultaneously not creating any dependencies. Abhishek has created the space for other organizations to take up ownership for the work, while keeping the hand on the pulse of the general workflow. He is also able to disagree/pushback against client suggestions and provide valuable inputs into all external client discussions. He has supported me in taking up more space in client meetings and leading interactions with our partner counterparts.

I appreciate that Abhishek gives me space and trust to lead and manage the workflow. He is present for our regular check-ins and I am bale to check-in with him on anything I have doubts about.  and rewrite the following notes using the same grammar and writing style (only active voice, concise words and sentences) - 
generating insights - great at generating insights, can empower and support direct reports, ability to push team thinking forward
> example - narrative building for analysis

deliverables - actively coaching direct reports on their deliverables and able to improve their skills; maintains high quality in all deliverables from teams;

oral comms - great at facilitation of workshops and leading discussions, ability to navigate difficult discussions, coach team
mentoring into new roles

client relations - lego as difficult context, manage relations, pushback to clients setting boundaries, e.g. concept note for government partnerships, leading multiple sessions at workshops, 

Develops thought professional partner relationship with multiple senior client /funder maps and directly builds client respect for IDinsight; demonstrating strong intuition and humility to manage expectations and lead to positive relationships and subsequent social impact; able to handle even the most challenging and complex client, funder, and stakeholder interactions well, including mitigating difficult situations indepedently; completely trusted to represent IDinsight independently, and is viewed by client/funder as trusted senior advisor

Section 1: Introduction and Framework for Advancing Women in Leadership




1.1 Background: This compendium is designed to serve as a comprehensive guide for monitoring and evaluating the progress of women in leadership roles. 
1.2 Purpose of the Compendium: It aims to provide a structured approach to measure the effectiveness of interventions and to support the achievement of gender equality in leadership as outlined in SDG 5.5.
1.3 Conceptual Framework: The conceptual framework underpinning this compendium is built upon a thorough review of formative research into the determinants and interventions that advance women in leadership (WIL). A Theory of Change (ToC) has been developed to outline the path from interventions to outcomes, with a focus on illustrative final outcomes. The matrix of interventions against barriers to WIL advancement provides a strategic overview of the areas covered by the compendium.
1.4 Methodology: The methodology for developing the measures and indicators included in this compendium involved close collaboration with the WIL team and partners. This included consultative processes such as workshops at the London WIL Convening and follow-up sessions in India and Kenya. These engagements ensured that the indicators are outcome and impact-focused, reflecting the practical experiences and insights of those working to advance WIL.
1.5 Scope:  The scope of this compendium encompasses a range of interventions, from leadership development programs to legislative reforms, each with corresponding measures and indicators. It is structured to guide users through understanding and applying these indicators to their specific contexts.
1.6 Use of the Compendium: Intended for a diverse audience, including policymakers, practitioners, and researchers, this compendium provides practical guidance on how to use the indicators to track progress and impact. Users are encouraged to refer to the Acronyms and Glossary of Definitions section for clarity on terms used throughout the document.




Section 2: Indicator Matrix (3-6 pages) 
2.1 Measures and Indicators for Key Interventions for Advancing Women in Leadership The subsection will include the tables of indicators and measures, organized by intervention, with guidance on how compendium users can understand and use the information in the tables.
2.2 Illustrative Final Outcomes and Impact This new section will include indicators for measuring illustrative final outcomes, such as increased women's leadership, and impact outcomes, including the two SDG 5.5 sub indicators (political representation and managerial positions). It will also provide the names of programs that have used the indicators and the contexts in which they were used.

In a few areas, we make a suggestion around framing or formatting. You have been closer to this work than we have, so please push back or suggest alternative approaches if something doesn’t make sense.
 
For next steps: 
* Please review the feedback, and let us know if any of it is unclear.
* If you need minor clarifications, we’re happy to resolve those over email.
* If you have bigger questions,  we’d be happy to schedule a brief call to clarify. If you’d like to do this, please reply with some times in the next 1-2 weeks when your team is available.
* Assuming the feedback is clear, please make a next draft and share with us for review before finalizing. We may have feedback on content that should be expanded or condensed as you develop it.
* It would be helpful to hear when you anticipate having the next draft.
* Overall, we feel that this is headed in the right direction and are grateful for your thought partnership and collaboration! Thanks again.




 
 
Contents Section:
1. For the Forward section, thank you for suggesting the section on the statement from BMGF leadership. So you know, it can take a lot of time and several levels of review to get official statements like this. Let’s keep the placeholder for now, but we’re not sure exactly what this will look like in the final document.
2. Please include a section to define any acronyms you use.
3. You may also consider having an up-front section with a glossary of definitions, for those less familiar with MLE (alternatively, it may be easier to just define them in the text.)
 
Section 1/Section 2:
1. Overall, we recommend shortening the up-front sections so the document has more of a focus on the indicator matrix.
2. Section 1 and section 2, and potentially section 3.1 can likely be combined into one section. We understand that developing the Theory of Change and Matrix of interventions were key steps in developing background knowledge for the indicators – so would recommend framing work briefly as part of the background or methodology.
Would recommend that, as part of methodology, you mention that close work with the WIL team was part of developing these frameworks.
* However, for the TOC graphic, please remove the label “BMGF WIL strategy goals” from the green box. The team is in the process of updating their goals internally, so we should avoid this language for now. These could be re-labeled something like “illustrative final outcomes.”




3. We anticipate that the “interventions” table would raise a lot of questions for the reader, such as, “have the interventions here been tested, and shown to reduce the associated barriers?” Please describe the process you used to determine which barriers got checkpoints for what interventions. Either cite sources here, or explain that sources will be cited in their respective sections.
4. In the methods section, please explain the decision to organize the compendium by intervention.
* As part of your methods section, please include one-two lines that summarizes IDI’s engagement with WIL partners in informing this report, specifically to account for the MLE session at the London WIL Convening + follow-up workshops in India and Kenya. If we decide to pursue additional WIL partners engagement to inform the Compendium draft, you can build in additional language later to reflect that.
 
Measures and Indicators Section:
* We would like to see sections on illustrative final outcomes (such as increased women’s leadership) and impact.
* The ToC graphic identifies illustrative final outcomes. Please include a section with indicators which could be used to measure these. The GH5050 reports, for example, include options relevant to some of the indicators.
* For Impact outcomes, include the two SDG 5.5 sub indicators (political representation and managerial positions).
* Please write out the sources, as opposed to just including links.
We assume that you have left out the “validation” information as many of these indicators have not been validated. At the very least, it would be helpful to see names of programs who have already used the indicators, and the contexts in which they use them. Consider adding another column with this information. “ and 2)draft a response to the gates team, complete with a checklist of what has been addressed, and clarifying questions, off their feedbck.”",PROJECTS

I did qualitative surveys with participants of an intervention to have their perception on dignity. my workshop is with organizations implementing the program. based on this content, what questions can I have for discussion at the end? 
Dignity has been a central component of the C2P intervention. IDinsight led the mapping and prioritisation of dignity hotspots in our ToC, a series of dignity sessions with the C2P operations team, and the collection of dignity stories from our qualitative process evaluation interviews. 

Dignity Hotspot Mapping - We conducted the dignity hotspot identification to ensure the C2P intervention prioritises interactions where dignity is most at risk and takes targeted actions to promote respectful and dignified practices. To identify dignity hotspots, we mapped interactions among stakeholders and participants of the C2P intervention. We listed all activities and identified individuals who would interact within the scope of each activity. Using our ToC as the base layer, we included additional layers visualising the interactions between 1) FLWs and caregivers, 2) FLWs and AWWs, 3) C2P and FLWs, 4) C2P and AWWs, and 5) C2P and caregivers. 

IDinsight facilitated 2 dignity workshops where C2P partners brainstormed and reflected on ways to include dignity in our intervention. Consequently, we decided to focus on dignity experiences in the interactions between 1. Caregivers and FLWs, and 2. Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and FLWs. 

As FLWs deliver the program to beneficiaries, their role and approach are central to the quality and impact of our intervention. FLWs can build trust and rapport with participants through interactions that respect participants’ dignity. Research suggests that when participants feel respected and valued, they are more likely to open up, share personal information, and cooperate (Hutchfield, 1999; Lundqvist & Nilstun, 2007; Valentine, 1998). When addressing caregivers respectfully, FLWs can foster effective communication, enabling participants to ask questions, raise concerns, or share challenges. FLWs’ dignified approach can ensure the basis for long-term community partnerships, where impact can ripple through the community, fostering an environment of mutual respect. Respect for dignity empowers participants and makes them more likely to engage in the program longer. 

As a next step, we decided to design and hold dignity sessions with FLWs to ensure the integration of the dignity lens in day-to-day field operations. 

Dignity Sessions - The objective of these dignity sessions was to understand FLWs’ experiences on the field and promote respectful and empathetic practices toward project participants. 
We conducted 6 dignity sessions with the C2P operations team, ranging from 1.5 to 4 hours (August 2023, October 2023, November 2023, February 2024, and April 2024). Most sessions were attended by 11 FLWs and 3 Project Coordinators. During the sessions, we discussed informative content on dignity (articles, videos, scenarios), engaged in role-play activities, shared personal stories, and reflected on experiences from the field. At the end of each discussion, we asked for suggestions for the themes of upcoming sessions. 

Dignity Module in the Process Evaluation - We also wanted to understand how C2P participants think of dignity. In our qualitative interviews, we asked caregivers what dignity means to them and about experiences where they felt respected and disrespected. 

Participants referred to dignity as honor, respect, dignity, prestige, and value. Almost all participants (20 out of 21) said dignity is important to them, while 1 respondent was unsure. Common themes across dignity definitions included mutual respect (7), respectful communication (5), a core part of human identity (5), reputation (2), education (1), or happiness (1). In a few interviews, respondents mentioned that respect could be lost through bad actions and earned through good deeds, implying it is not an innate quality. 2 participants (a male and a female) mentioned gender when discussing dignity, primarily the need for women to be respected. 

Caregivers’ definitions displayed some overlap with the wider body of literature. The literature discusses human dignity in relation to respect, integrity, worth, or wholeness (Polonko & Lombardo, 2005). According to Kant (1785), dignity is inherent and cannot be compromised. Few caregivers mentioned that dignity is part of being a human, imitating its innate character. Respondents stated that everyone should be treated with respect regardless of age (3), including elders (3) and children (3). Caregivers’ views on children’s dignity are central as literature establishes that dignity can influence a child’s long-term learning, social, and emotional outcomes (Schore, 2001; Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000). Lansdown (2005) emphasizes that children should be raised in respectful environments, and the interactions should be rooted in respect for children and their abilities. 

We also asked participants about instances where they felt respected and disrespected. Notably, female respondents mentioned examples more closely linked to family (primarily husbands or in-laws), while male respondents more frequently told stories linked to the broader community, friends or their workplace. We have attached examples of some definitions of dignity and dignity stories below. 

What is dignity for you? Do you think dignity is important? Why or why not?

Dignity is fundamental to a person’s identity - “It is very important. Without it, life is useless. In the eyes of others, it is always important to keep your head held high. If your head bows down in front of someone, then I think that person has died at that time.""

Everyone should be treated with respect, including children - “Everyone should be given respect and honour. If it's a child, they should be provided guidance without being harsh on them.”

Respect needs to be reciprocal - “Respect is necessary. Only when we respect others will someone respect us.”

Respect brings happiness - “It is important because getting respect is greater than any happiness. Because when one has respect in the eyes of people, then they hold a high status.”

Dignity is more important than money - “Money or wealth doesn't give me happiness. What gives me happiness is when someone talks to me with love or respects me. Then I feel very relaxed, and I like it.”

Respect is essential to building trust - “If you don't talk respectfully, I wouldn't want to meet you again. If I don't feel good talking to you once, I will refuse to meet you again.”


Can you recall a specific instance where you were treated with dignity?

Being supported in times of need - “It was a festival, and I was very unwell. My husband fully supported me in my work and household chores, so I felt happy at that time.”

Whenever something happens, like if the kids fall ill, our neighbours support us. They even take care of them at their home. If an adult falls sick, they send food to our home. Our neighbours are very friendly. They think of us as their own family. 

""(...) My wife had become very sick. I was quite troubled by that, and our neighbours greatly helped me. They helped with money, visited frequently to check and encouraged me. 

Ability to ask questions and clarify doubts - [Talking about an interaction with an FLW]  They talk very nicely, so I called them once in between with a query. They told us to ask questions without hesitation. So, after my call, I got a message, and they resolved my query.

Being praised or complimented - [Talking about an interaction with an FLW] ""The day we drew during the PEG meeting, FLW said my work was excellent. It felt really good, and I liked that day. 


Can you recall a specific instance where you felt disrespected?

Being excluded from the family - There have been many relationship challenges within the family. We have our own house, but our family members do not let us live there. We live on rent, so what could be more heart-wrenching for a person? This has caused immense hurt to me. 

Talked to in a disrespectful way - It does not feel good when my mother-in-law scolds me over the phone. This has happened in the last six months. Later, I told myself she was older than me and had the right to say things to me. That's how things are here. 

If I cook food at home late, the husband gets a bit angry. It happened a week ago. It hurts - I do so much. My only response is that I will do it on time from tomorrow.

The main limitation is we only received data from 7 provinces, and the quality and completeness of the data varies. Our engagement has included a comprehensive desk review of ZNBTS administrative data, encompassing donor inventories. This review informed the design of our large-scale data collection efforts targeting blood donors and non-donors. Furthermore, it identifies gaps and potential solutions to the persistent blood shortage, focusing on understanding the composition of current blood donors and assessing the quality of blood donor data. 
This section presents an analysis of the data received as of April 15th, 2024, focusing on completeness, distribution, and generating summary statistics for relevant variables. 
Data Quality and Completeness

Completeness
The quality and completeness of the digital data received varies by province. Lusaka province is the most complete, as donor data is entered directly into a central database. As seen in Table 2 below, the number of donors captured varies significantly across the other provinces. Luapula, Muchinga, and Western provinces were requested to share their donor inventories but did not provide any data. We are uncertain which other provinces delivered complete or partial data for the date ranges provided. However, based on the average number of donors per month, we suspect that Lusaka, Central, Northern, and possibly Southern provinces have complete data for their respective date ranges but that the other provinces provided only some of the donor entries for those dates.",PROJECTS

Please add detail to section 2.2 with the following specifics:
Divide the section into two subsections, detailing the outcomes of women in leadership interventions.
The first subsection will be on the Illustrative Final Outcomes. 1) Provide an explanation on what illustrative are; outcome of intermediate outcomes in women. 2) List the illustrative final outcomes; a) Representation: This encompasses the diversity of women in various roles, their visibility in different sectors, the recognition they receive, and the confidence they build. b) Agency: This is reflected in women's power to act independently, their leadership and representation in decision-making roles, and their resilience, self-awareness, integrity, and authenticity. c) Empowerment: This outcome is a combination of access to resources, support systems, having a voice in matters that affect them, and self-efficacy. d) Influence: This includes the recognition of women's contributions, their visibility in leadership roles, and the diversity they bring to these positions. e) leadership: resilience, self-awareness, integrity, authenticity. f) power. 3) For each of these illustrative final outcomes, specify metrics from the indicator matrix to measure them.
The second subsection will be on Impact Outcomes. 1) Define the two impact outcomes as the sdg 5.5 goals. 2) Indicate how these outcomes ladder up from the intermediate outcomes and the illustrative final outcome. The impact outcomes are rooted in the sdg 5.5 goals. 3) For each of these impact outcomes, specify metrics from the indicator matrix to measure them.
Find a suitable name for the section, using the above specifics.

This complete. I had flagged to Valentina that I was having a week and asked for a MOnday review. She asked me to keep you both in the loop as you have your eye on the deadlines. 
The matrix has not been included in text of the compendium, but has been section in the matrix by intervention. These can be viewed in tandem in the separate sheets. This is to avoid bulkiness in the text, will request for comms input once completed. 
What has worked, what hasn’t: hallenges have been identifying Case Examples of who has used the Compendium and how they have used it. I have leaned on researh reports from partners and from literature on the ones used. Most of them have been quantitative as opposed to qualitative. 








Where are we at with the Draft Compendium?
This is almost complete. 
What has been filled out: What I have filled out are the section 1 and 2 which encompass the Introduction to the Compendium with the background and purpose, the scope and use, the conceptual framework, the methods, and the conceptual framework.
What has not been filled out: What I have not filled in the front load and tail end of the draft  which is the Acknowledgements, Table of Contents, Foreword, List of Acronyms, Glossary, Executive Summary as well as the Annex and the full References. 
Highlights of the compendium: 1) Addressed the comments from BGGF. 
I have removed the constructs in the indicator matrix. The constructs are now highlightes as “illustrative final outcome” and those are described in a different section in the compendium alind with measures for sdg 5.5.
Timelines: 
Reviews of the Compendium/Matrix are Monday and Tuesday working in the reviews on Tuesday and Wednesday based on Valentina and Mulenga’s reviews. I have put Rachel’s review as Wednesday afternoon and to have the revision worked on through Thursday. With the final draft go over by Mulenga on Friday before sending it to the team.

2765,2024-05-15,8bddbc9b-3161-47cf-81f8-6bd5ac645176,12765,,,"Dear [Name],
As a trusted ally in our movement to uphold dignity in development, we are excited to share with you an exciting update from our team.
IDinsight's Dignity Initiative plans to carry out a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) designed to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of dignity-focused interventions. This study aims to measure the impact of these interventions on the felt respect for dignity of program participants, with the ultimate goal of informing future decision-making in program design and policy development.
Why This Study and Why Now
This RCT is a response to an emerging call from the development sector for a more human-centered approach backed by solid data and evidence. It is a pivotal next step in our movement to promote dignity in development and a key component of our agenda for this year. We believe this study will lay an evidence based foundation that will enable and inspire a larger conversation on the value add of centering participant voices and experiences in global development. 
Introducing the RFP
By launching the attached RFP, we are officially starting the search for a dynamic implementation partner who can co-design the study with us and implement it in their programs.
The ideal partner
Commitment and alignment to values of dignity and respect.
The ability to engage with and respect cultural diversity.
Financial and operational capacity to manage large projects.
Demonstrated experience in research and evaluations of their programs.
Experience with data collection, management, and analysis in compliance with ethical standards and privacy regulations.
Should have an established large scale program to provide a sufficiently large number of participants ensuring a robust sample size for the RCT (ranging from a couple hundred communities to a couple of thousand individual participants).
Call to Action

We invite you to review the attached RFP, which outlines the specific requirements and expectations for the study. If your organization, or an organization know of any partners within your network for whom this RCT could be relevant, we would be grateful if you could share the RFP with them.
For any further information or to discuss this opportunity in more detail, please feel free to reach out directly to the Dignity Initiative team on dignity@idinsight.org. Your insights and connections could be invaluable in finding the right partner forto bring this RCT and contributing to the evidence… to fruition.
Thank you for your continued support and for being an ally in our journey towards a more dignified world.

Best Regards,

Limited dissemination/knowledge of the Mission Karmayogi ecosystem (MK purpose, terminologies -‘competencies’ ‘FRAC’) amongst stakeholders (including MDOs).
Limited understanding on the part of MDO admins and leaders about their role in the ecosystem, championing iGOT, carrying out FRACing, enabling employees to build competencies.
Limited domain competencies on the platform (and not enough creation of the domain courses by the relevant MDOs)
Low quality courses available on the platform (which I believe is partially related to the lack of a marketplace policy where there are financial incentives for providing better quality courses)
Data insights? While they’re moving in this direction, Karmayogi Bharat is currently not providing enough guidance/direction to MDO leaders in terms of what they should focus on. For instance, they’ve created dashboards for MDO leaders, but usage is low and possibly some training is required in order to empower them to draw insights from the data. Similarly, KB sometimes flags to MDOs if their users are doing courses super fast (spending 2 minutes on a 30 minute course) but this isn’t done systematically. If they’re able to either empower MDOs or provide regular data insights on what’s going on, there may be better platform utilisation, identification of MDO level challenges etc.",PROJECTS

How are you doing? I haven’t checked in a while, I apologise for not acknowledging receipt of the above - It’s been a busy coupleof weeks for me. Thank you for sharngall. 




I had a discussion with Machenje and Sylvia (the country lead) regarding the June menu, and some outcome thoughts of the discussion wee:
- to replace the t-bone with beef stew instead? the t-bone has been a lttle tough for the teammates to get through. 
- to replace the pork curry with do pork chops? The team generally enjoys the grilled/braid pork chops. 
* to bring fish on the 11th and 25th and not  concurrently in back-to-back weeks. 
* to have more coleslaw: generally the team prefers coleslaw over Greek salad as well, it would be nice to get more of it.
* Sylvia flagged she’d also like to see  more greens on the menu. These could be local veggies or steamed combos.
* ust a noite of thnanks for the vegeterian options. Those have been very diverse and accomodatign to our non-meat eating staff, and would like that to continue. 




With the feedback, please let men know if all can be incorporated, or if more discussion is needed. Thank you!""",POLICIES

Hello Brian,
I am glad you asked. To be honest, I was hoping the remuneration would somehow mitigate my current package and benefits. Taking on this role would have meant  a difference of about 20K in my monthly income and losing my current benefits, which include global health insurance coverage, flight benefit, professional development stipend, monthly phone and internet stipend, wellness stipend and tech stipend to mention a few.
I hope this helps.
